you this; you're getting older\nAnd there's improvements unless\nYou're such a winner\nThat the future's a nightmare\nAnd there's nothing I can do\nNothing anyone can do about this\nAnd oh, I'm

been deleted\nBy versions of selves that we thought were the best ones\n'Til versions of versions of others repeating\nCome laughing at everything we thought was important\nWhile still making mistakes that you thought you had learned from\nAnd reasonable people know better than you\nThat cost in the long run but they don't know the short game\nAnd terrible people know better than you\nThe use and abuse of the wants of dear listener\nSo you will be badgered and taunted and told that\nYou're missing a party that you'll never get over\nYou hate the idea that you're wasting your youth\nThat you stood in the background oh until you got older\nBut that's all lies\nThat's all lies\nIt's gonna have to be good enough, I can't do this anymore, my brain won't "}, "call the police": {"track_id":

there with all my best friends\nI remember\nI remember the look on your face\nThe way you said, with your eyes\nYou said\n\nAnd then I slipped out of the Sun's sphere of influence\nNothing was happening\nIt was so dizzying\nAnd then you took everything from me\nI was left here, a shell of my self\nI was left here to pick up the pieces\nAnd every piece was...\nLove, give me love\nThat's when you saved me\nAt the last possible moment\nYou brought your big hand out\nAnd scooped up my ship\nAnd took me home\nThat day you gave a new faith\nIn how people can save one another\nInstead of always putting out their hands\nTo crush\n\nWhen you're out in space\nYou feel so light\nNa-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na\nWhen you're out in space\nYou feel so light\nNa-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na,

see everything from here\nIsn't it beautiful?\nIt is beautiful\nI bet you know what you need to know by now\nJust take a moment\nI must admit your technology is wonderful\nI've never seen anything like this\nWill you accept our friendship?\nWithout hesitation\nI didn\u2019t say we could promise anything more than that\nUnless you\u2019re seeing everything for the first time\nAlright\nThat is everything\nStep through the door\nI have already stepped through the door\nThen welcome\nI see no need for this\nWho's that?\nI wasn't to talk to you\nWho is that?\nWho's talking?\nI want to talk to you about a few things\nIs that a voice in my head?\nHelp me understand why your friends are all afraid\nHelp me understand why your friends are all afraid\nGet out of my head\nThey\u2019re from New

away, wash it away\nAll of the pain, all of the pain and anger\nIt slips away, love slips away\nBut it will remain, it will remain unanswered\n\nNow I'm listening to Kanye on the Taconic Parkway,

lookin' for some clientele\nLife on the dirty, dirty Jane, I swear my block be so famous\nShe ain't wanna come around, she said, \"It's too dangerous\"\nI said, \"My lifestyle is amazing\"\nI learned how to get it from the struggle, I ain't basic\nProduct of the field\nWe ain't had no money, but had a loaded steel\nShe ain't really know his pain, she left him when it's real\nSee, niggas think they was gangster, they geekin' off the pills\nDetectives, they be honest, they think brodie he was on a drill\nAnd that first nigga who died, gave him a birthday wish\nGet up super close, I swear that glizzy kiss\nBrother told me he was smiling, laughing when he seen him twitch\nGot lot of killers in this mansion, girl, don't let 'em in\n\nI seen my OG cry\nIt be hurting her but she know that I'm livin' life\nIt's just the fact we come from a bloody scene, it's a scary site\nDon't get caught on the fences, green beam, it's on sight\nAnd we ain't never call for no protectors\nMy brother know I'm there with him\nYeah, he there with me\nLot of niggas ain't gang, but say they gang, so it's , fifty\nI write you everyday, \"Do you miss me?\"\nLook what we done, baby, we got history\nLook what we done, nigga, we got history\nWe was loadin' G-Locks way before fifteen\nFell in love with mmm-money route, my main squeeze\nFeeling safe with DP on the drill, I know he gon' squeeze\nWe from the sea so I'll show you how to swing a rod\nGot brothers across the street, for me, they go retarded\nDumb way, that dumb way, we know that death is promised\nBro, he got a sweater in the middle of

\"Hey, do you wanna see th\u0435 west with me?\n'Cause lov\u0435's out there and I can't leave it be\"\nAnd I said, \"Honey, love's never meant much to me\nBut I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need\"\n\nSo we made off for California\nTo find your lover, drivin' day and night\nAnd every small town diner\nSaw our faces at least once or twice\nBut in these motel rooms\nI started to see you differently, oh\n'Cause for the first time since I was a child\nI could see a man who wasn't angry\nAnd he said, \"It's been a long damn time since I left Florida\nNo one left to leave and no one left to love\nBut now that I met you, I finally know just where I'm headin'\"\nAnd we found heaven in time where your western sunshine\nMet my deep southern wet\nAnd you got lost in it and yet you found yourself\nHard-pressed for air and sweatin'\n\nAnd you said, \"Hey, do you wanna see the west with me?\n(Do you wanna see the west with me?)\n'Cause love's out there and I can't leave it be\"\n(I can't leave it, I can't leave it)\nAnd I said, \"Honey, love's never meant that much to me\n(Nothing much)\nBut I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need\"\n\nAnd once we reached the coast, you said, \"End of the line\nWe finally reached the edge after all this time\nI didn't find my love, but I still made it this far without it\"\nAnd then you turned to me and stared into me deep\nAnd said, \"Well, maybe not 'cause look at what I've got\nYou might not be my love, but, baby, I doubt it\"\nAnd you said, \"Hey, do you wanna see the west with me?\n'Cause love's out there and

direction of truth\n\nThere's no reason there's no secrets to decode\nIf you can't save it, leave it dying on the road\nWide open arms can feel so cold\nSo cold, feel so cold\n\nBalance the books, the ledges, the looms\nThe disappointed look on the faces that squint at the moon\nLet's see it with shadows enhanced\nAnd then vote to decide who'll advance\nSilver jet plane making a turn\nExciting the brain that expects it to crash and then burn\nIt's not the life lesson I'd've guessed\nIf you're conscious you must be depressed\nOr at least cynical\nBut someone might still eat the steaks\nEven if they're tough\nSpending the day, chewing at the fat\nFloating away isn't rough but it's not enough\n\nOh Marianne, pass me the joint\nThe sandpaper's tan, go-getters are surfing the point\nAnd London's a scratch on the lens\nIt's over before it begins\nSilk 'round her neck falls down to her shoulders\nThe older I get, the more I suspect there's a trick\nBut really there's no trip at all\nThat doesn't result in a fall\nOr a faltering\n\nBut something could spit out the bait\nEven if it's real\nRolling away, missing a spoke\nClose to the ground like a wheel, but it's not a joke\nHolding the line, clutching the phone\nNobly wasting the night, but it isn't right\nIt's not right\nSmelling for blood, praying for rain\nRunning away isn't rough, but it's not enough\n\nThe low tide is telling me when it's over\nTo breathe in everything exposed\nAnd comes back to cover me with a blanket\nBeing here's always changing tunes\n\n\nThe empty sky surrounds me but I can't see at all\nWide-open arms can feel so cold\nAnd you can sit beside me and tell me what it's worth\nBut I hope I die before I get sold\nI hope I die before I get sold\nI'd rather die before I get sold\n\nIf you find the soul that you lost\nFrozen in a starry void\nTake it within and hope the sight of blood\nCan will signs of life to return\nBack to the way that it was\nLong before it made a noise\nTo keep on quietly reminding you\nWhat's never created or destroyed\n\nWake as the swell peaks\nThe close-outs drowning the birds with roars\nAnd howls scare the new unkindness\nThat picks and laughs at the carrion scene\n\nForces you see breathe can always go into hiding\nAnd wait 'til it passes over\nOr stay far gone for all eternity\n"}, "Brian Eno": {"track_id": "4QbVaPjV46w52zemaIWYl8",

man get shot, but no one came for a long time because it happened in a remote parking lot in Las Vegas\nAnd she was waiting for her mom to come back from working the blackjack table at the Circus Circus casino\nAnd that night, her mom said that the two of them and the now dead guy were the only three people who ever really lived in Las Vegas\nEverybody else just arrived, ate their complimentary shrimp cocktail, and left\n\nRock me now in the arms of cobwebs (it's a one room city, yeah)\nRoll me out (so can you roll with me?)\nIn the arms of cobwebs (it's a one room city,
