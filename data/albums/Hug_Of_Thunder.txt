You said we're halfway home
You said survive
You said we're halfway home
You said survive
Come right
Into the sunlight
'Cause I see their cold eyes
I fear they still burn
Like it was so what
As if it's so much
All through my fallen face
End to end
You said we're halfway home
You said survive
This is my horror time
This is my fallen fate
'Cause if you never run, never run
How they gonna catch you alive?
Yeah, if you never run, never run
How they gonna catch you alive?
You said we're halfway home
You said survive
You said we're halfway home
You said survive
Dreams change and I know that I'm gonna die
But I don't need what I know now
You were beautiful, my love
I see what I wanna hear
If you don't believe in headlights (So come right)
You won't get caught in the mighty (Into the sunlight)
It's the same no matter what we have here ('Cause I see the cold eyes)
It's the crossfire, it's the blazing fears, it's fall end to end (And I fear they still grow)
And you'll forget
Call out for a change
But not believe in anything
You will forget
Call out for a change
And not believe in anything, anything
You will forget
Call out for a change
Not believe in anything, anything
You will forget
Call out for a change
And not believe in anything
'Cause if you never run, never run
How they gonna catch you alive?
Yeah, if you never run, never run
How they gonna catch you alive?
Yeah, if you never run, never run
How they gonna catch you alive?
Yeah, if you never run, never run
How they gonna catch you alive?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Trackname: Stay Happy]
I came away unscathed
You came alive in your own state
I was naked and staring
At the face that I could not see
How could you be and I be
You set me straight at love
With your fists up and your bracelet
You're the belle and you beckon
The hours the minutes the seconds
The more you are will I be
Will I be me
There may be dogs at the door
But you are a lottery winner
And maybe it's my hard head
That keeps me dreaming
Rise and shine with dirt in your eyes
Sun in your head and never forget
That it's alright
Ok
Alright alright alright alright
Original wonder you gave it back to me
Original wonder originally
All the lies and loves that are competing
All the loves and lies that are competing
Original wonder you gave it back to me
Original wonder originally
You set me straight at love
With your fists up and your bracelet
You're the belle and you beckon
The hours the minutes the seconds
The more you are I will be
I will be me
I will be me
The hours the minutes the seconds
I will be me
The hours the minutes the seconds
I will be me
The hours the minutes the seconds
I will be me
The hours the minutes the seconds
I will be me
The hours the minutes the seconds
I will be me

[Trackname: Vanity Pail Kids]
Do you remember your house
Like a super high five
Do you remember your mouth
And all the mythical lies
You wanna be the size of your love
You wanna be the size of your god
You wanna be the size of this trust
You must make sure that you steal it
You wanna be the size of your sex
You wanna be the size of your mess
You wanna be the size of what's next
You must make sure that you steal it
(Oh yeah baby, oh)
(I just feel so good)
You wanna be the size of your love
You wanna be the size of your god
You wanna be the size of this trust
You must make sure that you steal it
You wanna be the size of your sex
You wanna be the size of your mess
You wanna be the size of what's next
You must make sure that you steal it
All the time we wait for more
You don't have it all
Do you remember your house
And all the superman kids
Do you remember your mouth
Before they ruined all this
You wanna be the size of your love
You wanna be the size of your god
You wanna be the size of this trust
You must make sure that you steal it
You wanna be the size of your sex
You wanna be the size of your mess
You wanna be the size of what's next
You must make sure that you steal it
All the time we wait for more
You must make sure that you steal it
You don't have it all
You must make sure that you steal 

[Trackname: Hug Of Thunder]
Many years before I kept track of the years I felt I would look back Otherwise why did I write down everything that entered my mind?
Check out these lines, like -
"I'm Syd Barrett and I'll swim to England in his clothes, inholes"
How could I say at what point I would gain perspective let alone know I had it?
Survival by the soundtrack made of our short lives
Making sense of hologram ecology
I'll be up crying listening to Grace
And hiding in the pages adding up to me
Eternity
'til I leave
It's like a topography that is made from cartography of me,
All those feelings
Every day the bus stop was the size of the entire world
The ball that broke your tooth
And carving at me all the time was I had done you wrong
I hope I'm sorry
Certain times in our lives come to take up more space than others
And time's gonna take it's time
The Kennys said I broke in over the summer
It was the evening when he climbed that tree
I was afraid what he was doing inside so I followed him to stop a robbery
All along we're gonna feel some numbness
Oxymoron of our lives
Getting fed up by that hunger
Supersize we found inside
They will know it's real, our numbness
Catching up and climbing life
Speaking like a hug of thunder
Lit up by the lights at dusk outside
All along we're gonna feel some numbness
Oxymoron of our lives
Getting fed up by that hunger
Supersize we found inside
They will know us by our numbers
Catching up and climbing life
Speaking like a hug of thunder
Lit up by the lights at dusk outside
There was a military base across the street
We watch them training while we leaned
There was a military base across the street
We watch them training while we leaned
We watch them training while we 

[Trackname: Towers And Masons]
They came to wed, and show
We came in late, touch score
Walking along
Avenue
Walking along
Struck in two, and found
Falling, falling
Back to towers and masons
I can't wait 'til the world
To know when
Falling, falling
Back to towers and masons
I can't wait to know
You'll notice
It's a mess
They crawled out
Of shells
They crawled out of
Their shells
They crawled out
Of shells
They crawled out of
Their shells

[Trackname: Victim Lover]
Look at the moon look after you
Look at all the things you didn't do
It's easy to believe disaster tries
Look at the stars look at the cars
Look at the things you pretend are yours
While we choke the sleep that you disguise
I'm still trying
Trying
Trying to deceive that this is right
Yeah I'm crushing
Crushing
Crushing on the prisoner by design
Look at the clues look at the bruise
Look at all the things that you did lose
I don't think this girl could crack a smile
Eat up the hearts, release the charts
Do what you think is why you're who you are
Estimate the dark of gone tonight
Oh, the winter minds, dream of the sea to arrive alive
My war is not better, my better is the best that you will find
Look at the men look at your friend
Look at the one you want to never end
Hostage like to feed the metre dimes
Look at the door look at your floor
Look at the face you want some more
Beaten down by the lonely pride
It's not me, it's not you, not them, not this time
It's not me, it's not you, not them, not this time
Oh, the winter minds, love to dream to arrive alive
Oh, the winter minds, dream of the sea to arrive alive

[Trackname: Please Take Me With You]
Please take me with you
I'm so tired
All the fools are winning
And nobody's wild
It's all about the fingers
Not about the eye
Please take me with you
I need your kind
And we'll run away for life
Yeah we'll run away for life
(S M C I T Y see the light above ya)
(S M C I T Y see the light above ya)
Please take me with you
It's getting dark
And nobody's speaking
Everyone's getting caught
All the men are leaving
There's nothing to start
Please take me with you
I want your heart
And we'll run away for life
(S M C I T Y see the light above ya)
Yeah we'll run away for life
(S M C I T Y see the light above ya)
Please take me with you
Yeah, I'm so tired

It's all about the fingers
It's not about the eyes
(S M C I T Y see the light above ya)
Please take me with you
I need your kind

[Trackname: Gonna Get Better]
Future's not what it used to be
We still got to go there
Future's not what it used to be
You are all whispers, all whispers
Just a whisper
If you can
Got to go there
Future's not what it used to be
But we still gotta
Things'll get better
'cause they can't get worse, oh
Things'll get better
'cause they can't get worse
No they can't get worse
Things are gonna get better
I don't want to speak for you
I don't want to speak for you
I can't hear you
Tell me what you got to say
I can't hear you
Things'll get better
'cause they can't get worse, oh
Things'll get better
'cause they can't get worse
No they can't get worse
Things are gonna get better
Things are gonna get worse
Things will get better
Well I can't be the most of you
The temperature, once arose
I don't know what you like
It's gotta be
A photograph
You cannot believe a mouth
Who knows what they wanted
You cannot believe
Who knows what they want
Things'll get better
'cause they can't get worse, oh
Things'll get better
'cause they can't get worse
No they can't get worse
Things are gonna get better
Your head in my heart
Your head in my heart
Head in my heart
Head in my heart
Head, heart
Head, heart

[Trackname: Mouth Guards Of The Apocalypse]
How did this happen
Yeah, everybody quit
It's dancer and hatred
And the radio sounds like shit
If you can't help me
Then help someone like me
'cause it all went away, and it went quietly
Words of hope are a joke for the numb
The poets a liar and we all want some
It's me and it's you and it's all I can do
To not jump from the building
Jump right into you
Our heroes are dicks
We don't pay to protect them
If zero's a lover
I can't get a correction
The truth, the truth
That fabulous lie
I'm tired of smiling
While you constantly die
I don't wanna be scared
Or addicted to the dream
This fight is a ghost
Whose suicide was unseen
I'm done, I'm done
I wanna kill all my friends
I wanna grab them from the dark
And show them their end
It's you
It's me
And it's all we believe
I'm trying for the living and I'm staying
So I can leave
