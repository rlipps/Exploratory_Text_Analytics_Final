[Trackname: Spitting Off the Edge of the World]

Cowards! Here's the sun!
So, bow your heads
In the absence of bombs
Draw your breath

Dark, dark places shall be none
She's melting houses of gold
And the kids cry out:

We're spitting off the edge of the world
Out in the night
Never had no chance
Nowhere to hide
Spitting off the edge of the world
Out comes the sun
Never had no chance
Nowhere to run

Mama, what have you done?
I trace your steps
In the darkness of one
Am I what's left?
Silver lines whisper to me
Wounded arms must carry the load
And the kids cry out:
We're spitting off the edge of the world
Out in the night
Never had no chance
Nowhere to hide
We're spitting off the edge of the world
Nowhere to run
Never had no chance
Out comes the sun
Spitting off the edge of the world
Winds from the sky
Never had no chance
Will watch us rise

Oh, let the time come
Oh, when hearts fall in love
Oh, let no one see you
Let nothing hold you
Come close

[Trackname: Wolf]

I'm hungry like a wolf
I bleed like a wolf

I'm lost and I'm lonely
I hunger for you only
Don't leave me now, don't break the spell
In heaven, lost my taste for hell

Taste for hell
Taste for hell
Mm, mm

I'm hunted like a wolf
I feed, I feed like a wolf

I'm lost and I'm lonely
I hunger for you only
Don't leave me now, don't break the spell
In heaven, lost my taste for hell

Taste for hell
Taste for hell
Oh, oh
Into the wild with me

[Trackname: Fleez]

You know I won't do battle with no fiction
The wilderness is becoming my addiction
I shuffle round the creatures and the lords
The lords

On the road again
I make my transformation
And it feels nice
To roll the dice
Once or twice

Fleez and me eating nuts in the leaves
That's where we dance to ESG
Fleez and me eating nuts in the leaves
That's where we dance to ESG (Like this)

Very moody, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Very moody, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Very moody, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Very moody, yeah, yeah, yeah

I make my transformation
And it feels nice
To roll the dice
Once or twice
On the road again, baby
That's right
Fleez and me eating nuts in the leaves
That's where we dance to ESG
Fleez and me eating nuts in the leaves
That's where we dance to ESG (Like this)

Very moody, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Very moody, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Very moody, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Very moody, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ow!

[Trackname: Burning]

Believer
Took me over like a fever
Caught you hiding in the smoke, smoke, smoke
Like a meteor, I glow, glow, glow

Ooh
Lay your red hand on me, baby
Ooh, ooh
As I go

Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning

What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do when you get to the water?
Well, I'll release her
From the bindings of her teachers
What they're hiding there is broke, broke, broke
Like the river Styx, I flow, flow, flow

What you gonna do when you get to the water?
What you gonna do when you get to the water?
What you gonna do when you get to the water?
What you gonna do when you get to the water?
What you gonna do when you get to the water?
What you gonna do when you get to the water?
What you gonna do when you get to the water?
What you gonna do when you get to the water?

Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning

[Trackname: Blacktop]

Thunder lights the road
Blacktop rolling under God
Now we're dancing close
One to one as our bodies lock

One to one, we sway
On our way home
One to one, we sway
And all the pain flows

Open, open
Opened up
Open, open
Opened up

Oh, as I was young and easy
In the mercy of his means
Time held me green and dying
Though I sang in my chains like the sea

One to one, we sway
One to one, home
One to one, we sway
And all the pain flows
Flows
Hello, hold on 'til the love is gone
Hello, hold on 'til the love is gone
Hello, hold on 'til the love is gone
Gone home, home

[Trackname: Different Today]

I feel different today, different today
Different today, I do

Different today 'bout you

Oh, how the world keeps on spinnin'
It goes spinnin' out of control
How the world keeps on spinnin'
It goes spinnin' out of control
How the world keeps on spinnin'
It goes spinnin' out of control
How the world keeps on spinnin'
It goes spinnin', yeah

I feel different today, different today
Different today, I do
I feel different today, different today
Different today 'bout you

I don't want to wait 'til you leave
To say what I really mean
No, I don't want to wait 'til you leave
To say what I really mean
It's how I feel differеnt
It's how I feel

I feel different today, differеnt today
Different today, I do
I feel different today, different today
Different today 'bout you (It's how I feel)

[Trackname: Mars]

I watched my favorite show tonight
The dance the light does on the sea's ever-shifting surface
Golden tunnel beckoning
Rosy, I can't come with you, not now
No more shimmering path
Just an orb hanging above
With all its heavenly fire contained in a complete circle
I asked my son what it looked like to him
"Mars," he said
With a glint in his eye
"Mars," he said
With a glint in his eye
