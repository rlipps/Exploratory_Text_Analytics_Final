[Trackname: The Mother We Share]

Never took your side, never cursed your name
I keep my lips shut tight, until you go-o-o-oh
And we've come as far as we're ever gonna get
Until you realise, that you should go-o-o-oh

Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share
Will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share
Will never keep our cold heart from calling

In the dying light, I'm the only one here
And I will cover you, until you go-o-o-oh
'Cause if I told the truth, I would always be free
And keep a prize with me, until you go-o-o-oh

Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share
Will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share
Will never keep our cold heart from calling
Into the night, for once, we're the only ones left
I bet you even know where we could go-o-o-oh
And when it all fucks up, you put your head in my hands
It's a souvenir for when you go-o-o-oh

Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share
Will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share
Will never keep our cold heart from 

[Trackname: We Sink]

Me, I've come apart and you made me
Float like a pretty box of your evil
So tired, so easy, I
Bleed out, what the fuck were you thinking?
We are gonna fall if you lead us
Nowhere, no wasted time

I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we lift our love
I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we lift our love

Me, let me stop for a second
The held heart only beats in the evening
Low tide, watching full flight
I tell you to cut it out if you make me
You know why, the slowest bark is a breather
How high? How will you decide?

I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we lift our love
I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we lift our love
So long, you keep stalling
Can you not see why? (Say, say, say)
Loved ones (Say, say, say)
That you see cry (Say, say, say)
A simple call seems right (Say, say, say)
And I know why (Say, say, say)

I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die (Say, say, say)
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we lift our love (Say, say, say)
I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die (Say, say, say)
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we lift our love (Say, say, say)

(Say, say, say)
(Get up after you)
(Say, say, say)
(Get up after you)

[Trackname: Gun]

You had better run from me
With everything you own
'Cause I am gonna come for you
With all that I have
I am gonna break you down
To tiny, tiny parts
I never believed, but I see it now
I'm learning your lesson, I'm learning your lesson

Did it make you feel so clever?
Did you wear it on your sleeve?
Did you see another picture
Where I was not a part so far entwined?
There's no other way, never run far
Take a good swing at me and everything is even
So finally, we agree: no place for promises here
You better run, you better run so

Hide, hide, I have burned your bridges
I will be a gun and it's you I'll come for
Hide, hide, now it's all so easy
I will be a gun and it's you I'll come for
Who are you to tell me how
To keep myself afloat
I treaded water all the while
You stuck in the knife that you held at my back

Did it make you feel so clever?
Did you wear it on your sleeve?
Did you see another lifetime
Where I was not a part so far entwined?
There's no other way, never run far
Take a good swing at me and everything is even
So finally, we agree: no place for promises here
You better run, you better run so

Hide, hide, I have burned your bridges
Now I'll be a gun and it's you I'll come for
Hide, hide, now it's all so easy
I will be a gun and it's you I'll come for

There's no other way, never run far
Take a good swing at me and everything is even
So finally, we agree: no place for promises here
You better run, you better run so
Hide, hide, I have burned your bridges
I will be a gun and it's you I'll come for
Hide, hide, now it's all so easy
I will be a gun and it's you I'll come for

And it's you I'll come for
And it's you I'll come for
And it's you I'll come for
And it's you I'll come for
And I'm gonna see that you won't go far
And I'm gonna see that you won't go far
And I'm gonna see that you won't go far
And I'm gonna see that you won't go 

[Trackname: Tether]

Where'd you go? You were there by my side
Keep believing it's my turn to hide
In a place where we don't have a prayer
There's a tether that's keeping me there

Trade our places
Take no chances
Bind me 'til my lips are silent
Stay where you are
Ever, after
Chasing things that we should run from

Will we ever get away from this place?
It's an image that's burned on my chest
For a moment you need me to stay
Cold-blooded and drifting away

Trade our places
Take no chances
Bind me 'til my lips are silent
Stay where you are
Ever, after
Chasing things that we should run from
I'm feeling capable of
Seeing the end
I'm feeling capable of
Saying it's over
I'm feeling capable of
Seeing the end
I'm feeling capable of
Saying it's over


I'm feeling capable of
Seeing the end
I'm feeling capable of
Saying it's over
I'm feeling capable of
Seeing the end
I'm feeling capable of
Saying it's over
I'm feeling capable of
Seeing the end
I'm feeling capable of
Saying it's over
I'm feeling capable of
Seeing the end
I'm feeling capable of
Saying it's 

[Trackname: Lies]

Faster, faster, you won't go far
Shouldn't leave, feeling faint, we both know why
You got to show me both knees, cold, I lie
Hold me slowly, hide me till I can fight
Always, we can sing, we can make time
Old songs, flood and flame, you could be mine
But you got to show me both knees, skin and bone
Clothe me, throw me, move me till

I can sell you lies
You can't get enough
Make a true believer of
Anyone, anyone, anyone
I can call you up
If I feel alone
I can feed your dirty mind
Like I know, like I know what you want

Icon of symmetry, swallowing sides
Fall down in front of me, follow my eyes
But I've got to see you moving, waste no time
Teach me, make me holy till
I can sell you lies
You can't get enough
Make a true believer of
Anyone, anyone, anyone
I can call you up
If I feel alone
I can feed your dirty mind
Like I know, like I know what you want

Anyone, anyone, anyone
Anyone, anyone, anyone
Like I know, like I know what you want
Like I know, like I know what you want

I can sell you lies
You can't get enough
Make a true believer of
Anyone, anyone, anyone
I can call you up
If I feel alone
I can feed your dirty mind
Like I know, like I know what you 

[Trackname: Under the Tide]

I'm watching you run
Run from the sidelines
Take in a breath, fill in your lungs
Keeping you alive
No fear, I'll be your eyes
I'll be your lifeline
And if I can be, I'll be your strength
And it won't be long now

Head up, head up
Keep holding, holding
Your head up, head up
Keep holding

If you can see and you believe
Why are you so scared?
But if you don't care, then why are we here
And what do you have left?

Head up, head up
Keep holding, holding
Your head up, head up
Keep holding, holding
Don't you take another step away from here
"I would go anywhere with you"
What a lie
I'll break down, but you will never see
Tell me, are you happy?
Are you really happy?

Stay under the tide
Stay in my eye line
Looking ahead, there is a chance
Wherever it all ends

Head up, head up
And stay strong
Holding your head up, head up
Keep holding, holding

Slowly cross off the days
That they say you can have
Try to retie the ties
That you will leave behind
Slowly cross off the days
That they say you can have
Try to retie the ties
That you will leave 

[Trackname: Recover]

The last one was a bit tuney

Caught out, cold
Hiding from you in a skin so old
I'll come clean
Everyone, everyone knows it's me

And if I recover
Will you be my comfort?
Or it can be over
Or we can just leave it here
So pick any number
Choose any colour
I've got the answer
Open the envelope

I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change or part ways
And you take what you need
And you don't need me
I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change our old ways
And you take what you need
And you know you don't need me
Blow by blow
Honest in every way I know
You appear
To face the decision I know you fear

And if I recover
Will you be my comfort
Or it can be over
Or we can just leave it here
So pick any number
Choose any colour
I've got the answer
Open the envelope

I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change or part ways
And you take what you need
And you don't need me
I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change our old ways
And you take what you need
And you know you don't need me
And you know you don't need me

And if I recover
Will you be my comfort
Or it can be over
Or we can just leave it here
So pick any number
Choose any colour
I've got the answer
Open the envelope

I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change or part ways
And you take what you need
And you don't need me
I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change our old ways
And you take what you need
And you know you don't need 

[Trackname: Night Sky]

I will carry you and give you life
I will cover you and show you the way
It's a sequence that you never learned
It's a lesson I will never forget
I can hear you in the overtones
Just an echo of the promise we made
Change the future, we can travel time
Or make us blind, so we can never look back
We can never look back

I'm the night sky
I'm the fire in your eyes
And I want you
Now and for all time
I'm the cold heart
I'm the secret that you hide
I'll be listening until you decide

I communicate in simple streams (Take your time)
I'm the only one who gave you the truth (Speak to me)
Once you leave me you were really gone (Far and near)
Give me something to remember you by (Always be)
All that's here is what you left behind (Majesty)
Slowly moving in the back of my mind (Can't forget)
Take a moment to remember me (And I will)
And make me blind so I don't ever look back
Only in your name
I will ne'er be free

I'm the night sky
I'm the fire in your eyes
And I want you
Now and for all time
I'm the cold heart
I'm the secret that you hide
I'll be listening until you decide

I'm the night sky
I'm the fire in your eyes
And I want you
Now and for all time
I'm the cold heart
I'm the secret that you hide
I'll be listening until you decide
I will ne'er be 

[Trackname: Science/Visions]

Breathe, don't speak
It's leaving your body now
Slow heart, set free
A circuit of consciousness
When you are truly yourself
You will succumb to a permanence
A light, by day
A shadow resides by night

I, I
Hear, hear
Your, your
Breathing
I, I
Feel, feel
You, you
Leaving

With understanding
You won't let it cast you down
A mind full of questions
A current to purify
Science and visions
Be near when I call your name
Or ask me a question
I, I
Hear, hear
Your, your
Breathing

Breathe, don't speak
It's leaving your body now

I, I
Feel, feel
You, you

Heart set free
A circuit of consciousness

Light by day
A shadow resides by night

You won't let it cast you down

[Trackname: Lungs]

How long till you leave it?
You should know that we're alone this time
Keep yourself a secret, you should know that
I will sell you a future you don't want
Like I did last time
I won't go slow
All the things you tell yourself
Offer no resolution

You know that this will break us
But you push as far as we can go
Taking every chance to find solutions
That never make anyone happy
We are done this time
You don't owe me
Take a final look at me
Take it, and drink it in

Breathe through me
Fill up your lungs with us
I will keep everything you give me
Till the time we let go
Breathe through me
Fill up your lungs with us
I will keep everything you give me
Till the time we let go
Keep me in your eyeline
Keep believing what you said before
I will change direction
I will tell you that everything's moving too slowly
Just another lie
One more untruth
You won't ever see through me
You will still drink it in

Breathe through me
Fill up your lungs with us
I will keep everything you give me
Till the time we let go

Breathe through me
(You know that this will break us
But you push as far as we can go)
Fill up your lungs with us
(Taking every chance to find solutions
That never make anyone happy)
I will keep everything
(We are done this time
You don't owe me)
You give me
(Take a final look at me)
Till the time
(Take it)
We let 

[Trackname: By the Throat]

Bad blood and no holds barred
A warning shot, a sacrifice that we made
(You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far)
(You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far)
Waste of time or waste of fear
Do it again, again till you unfocus them away
(You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far)
(You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far)

All that's golden
Is never real
And I won't play fair
With you this time
All that's golden
Is never so
And I'll be thankful
(You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far)
When you let go
(You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far)

With teeth, we've come this far
I'll take this thing by the throat and walk away
(You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far)
(You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far)
Remember me as I will you
Honesty will wreck this home that we made
(You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far)
(You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far)
All that's golden
Is never real
And I won't play fair
With you this time
All that's golden
Is never so
And I'll be thankful
(You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far)
When you let go
(You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far)

Taking over parts of mine
That I will pay for every time
If I could catch you and cut your ties
I would leave you every time

All that's golden
Is never real
And I won't play fair
(You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far)
With you this time
(You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far)
All that's golden
Is never so
And I'll be thankful
(You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far)
When you let go
(You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far)
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too 

[Trackname: You Caught the Light]

I hear you when you call
There's a sign for her and everyone
And go on, but not with me
And let it all fall down
Let it all fall down

Sky is light
You caught the light
You carried mine
You caught the light

They said that you would call
And take it all, it's history
And we'll laugh until the end
Let the rain come down
Let it all come down

Sky is light
(I have nothing but love for)
You caught the light
(The places that call me home)
You carried mine
(I have nothing but love for)
You caught the light
(The places that call me home)
Sky is light
(I have nothing but love for)
You caught the light
(The places that call me home)
You carried mine
(I have nothing but love for)
You caught the light
(The places that call me home

[Trackname: Strong Hand]

Why don't you tell me? What do you need?
There is a blank page for you
Give me the bones of what you believe
Maybe they'll save you from me
Will I be the strong hand keeping you safe?
Or will I break you in half?
And you will never be under my thumb
But you are not your own man

See the way we all run
When we know it all off by heart
Play it down, wait it all out
Will we win or lose it this time?

When the pressure's building for a great white hope
Do you give up the things that you love?
And the pressure's building till it takes you whole
Can you go back on your own word?

All of your brothers, they never died
For what you kill for slowly
How it will grind you into the ground
If you should try to hold me
See the way we all run
When we know it all off by heart
Play it down, wait it all out
Will we win or lose it this time?

When the pressure's building for a great white hope
Do you give up the things that you love?
And the pressure's building till it takes you whole
Can you go back on your own word?
When the pressure's building for a great white hope
Do you give up the things that you love?
And the pressure's building till it takes you whole
Can you go back on your own word

[Trackname: Broken Bones]

Catch them and kill them
Your only hope is evil
I will not die, I will keep quiet
I will hold you high above

You're on your own
Wait till dawn and then go

No help here from heaven
You're not as real as I am
I will wake at the dark hours
Until your blood is out

You're on your own
I'm lying in here
Inside your sleep
Keep yourself
Awake for this
Wait till dawn and then go

Our love will never die
Broken bones and promises
Your weakness is clear now
I see your kind eyes
You're on your own
Wait till dawn and then go

You are another one
Buried here by no one
I will keep you inside
With your soul alive

You're on your own
Keep your head
Beneath your hands
Play your part
All on your own
Closed and bruised
You're on your own

[Trackname: Gun - KDA Remix]

You had better run from me
'Cause I am gonna come for you
I am gonna break you down
I never believed, but I see it now

Did it make you feel so clever?
Did you see another picture?
There's no other way, never run far
Finally, we agree
You better run, you better run so

Hide, hide
I will be a gun and it's you I'll come for
Hide, hide, now it's all so easy
I will be a gun and it's you I'll come for

Who are you to tell me how
I treaded water all the while

Did it make you feel so clever?
Did you see another lifetime?
There's no other way
Take a good swing at me
Finally, we agree
You better run, you better run so
Hide, hide
Now I'll be a gun and it's you I'll come for
Hide, hide
I will be a gun and it's you I'll come for

Hide, hide, I have burned your bridges
Hide, hide, now it's all so easy
And it's you I'll come for

And it's you I'll come for

Hide, hide
Hide, hide
Hide, hide
Hide, hide
