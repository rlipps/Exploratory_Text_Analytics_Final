All your kind, they're coming clean
They shut their eyes, they miss their scenes
All your kind, they're spool and lance
They crash their kiss, they harmonize
All your kind, they're all your kind, they're
All your kind, they're coming clean
They sleep through keys, they kill their needs
It's good

[Trackname: Stars And Sons]

And when you let it
You ask for nothing
Why don't you share it?
All of the time you live
There's something that left
This one will know how far I live on
This one will ever know in this town
And in the red room at a distance
How would you know when?
You're the same when you're living
I don't know when, I don't know when

This one will know how far I live on
This one will know how far I live on

All of the time you wait
There's someone who left
And anyone can find all the rest
How would you show it?
You can see through the rest
I don't know when, it won't be this time

This one will know how far I live on
This one will know how far I live on

[Trackname: Almost Crimes - Radio Kills Remix]

You're like a messiah kind
Little kingdoms in your chest
I told you we'd make it, on for another
I told you we'd make it, on for more now (Put on all our best)
This is how they will live on
But we'd looked better if we win
I told you we'd make it on for another (Oh, I've been getting calls now out here)
I told you we'd make it on for another (On their mouths and chest)


Help this love before you leave
Demonstrations lack caress
I want you to take you, call on for life (Thank you for creating souls so silent)
The longer we make this, I got no way in here (Children sleep with dicks)
Your call keeps me up all night
Complication sees your best
Told you, I want it here longer for you (I've been getting calls now out here)
I waited, I waited, it's late night, she's waiting at home (On their mouths and chest)

We've got love and hate, it's the only way
We've got love and hate, it's the only way, ah

I think it's almost crime
I think it's almost crime
I think it's almost crime
I think it's almost time

[Trackname: Looks Just Like The Sun]

Looks just like the sun
Looks just like it
Looks just like the sun
Looks just like it
But it looks just like the sun
Looks just like it
But I'm breathing, thinking one

Heart is pounding in his chest
Reaches suddenly for his gun
Should be sailing in the West
Flower that could be his fun
(Keep going)
Tree of families on his head
Weary red, split open eyes
I'm on the corner, thinking about my bed
Ain't just in store and signifies
(One, two, three)

Looks just like
Looks just like it
Looks just like the sun
And it looks just like it
Looks just like the sun
And it looks just like it
But I'm breathing, thinking one
(Here we go)
Gold and red, the colours change as you can't forget
Turning back, you know I thought I knew, thought I knew someone
You better check your watch
I think it's time you left
To he, and darkness, still it's obvious to everyone
Darkness, still, it's obvious to everyone
Still it's obvious to every

Well, it looks just like sun
Looks just like it (Looks just like it)
Looks just like the sun (Looks just like it)
Looks just like it
Looks just like the sun (Looks just like it)
(Kevin, after this)
Looks just like it
(Here we go, Kev)
(Looks just like the sun) Looks just like the sun


(One, two, one, two)

[Trackname: Anthems For A Seventeen Year-Old Girl]

Used to be one of the rotten ones and I liked you for that
Used to be one of the rotten ones and I liked you for that
Used to be one of the rotten ones and I liked you for that
Now you're all gone, got your makeup on, and you're not coming back
Can't you come back?
Used to be one of the rotten ones and I liked you for that
Used to be one of the rotten ones and I liked you for that
Used to be one of the rotten ones and I liked you for that
Now you're all gone, got your makeup on, and you're not coming back

Bleaching your teeth, smiling flash, talking trash under your breath
Bleaching your teeth, smiling flash, talking trash under your breath
Bleaching your teeth, smiling flash, talking trash under your breath
Bleaching your teeth, smiling flash, talking trash under my window

Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me
Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me
Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me
Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me

Park that car, drop that phone
Park that car, drop that phone
Used to be one of the rotten ones and I liked you for that
Now you're all gone, got your makeup on, and you're not coming 

[Trackname: Cause = Time]

You come in, check my time
You've got fornication crimes
I've seen your hope on television
Where you've been, you were not were
They've got tricycles in skirts
This is a mouth that needs religion

And they all want to love the cause
'Cause they all need to be the cause
They all want to fuck the cause

So take me down, down through this
Kill the common law that missed
This is the blood I love to share
Little pistols and companion halls
Desperation tentacles
I've been alone since '
We've gotta menstruate in disguise
They know the three completes the five
This is a church that should believe

And they all want to free the cause
'Cause they all need to dream a cause
They all need to be a cause
You've got all and it's
Pretty good, but I
Seem to be in disbelief
You come in, check my time
You've got fornication crimes
I've seen your death on television
Cue immortal childlike times
Separation is divine
Here is a strike beneath your knees

And they all want to love the cause
'Cause they all need to be the cause
They all want to fuck the cause

Take me down, down through this
Kill the white within the bliss
Here is a waiting room that wants to save your life

And they all want to love the cause
They all need to be the cause
They all want to dream a cause
They all need to fuck the 

[Trackname: Shampoo Suicide]

All the lights we were
All the lights we were
All the lights we were
Do you remember

How they need something that's so hard
To come a time, some time we spent
(I cried for we when all was to come free
At the broken heart in the room)
Split your tongue down the semi kind
And show us lovers that don't love to live
Lick the kill that never knew
Eat the trees and then get off on time
Get us something with the finger kids
(I want it)
Put your teeth where you love to love
Drink some spit just to save your life
Bury parents in a moments time
Hate it all and you still use shampoo
You hate it all and you still use shampoo
Find some bullets in a backyard
Shoot them up with your favorite kid
Free them up like its another knife
Save them for when you thought you did
Seen the tricks all use shampoo
You hate it all
My daddy told me to get a life
Like the something of simple time
It tastes so good
I've seen your dreams and I wish you would
I've seen your choice and it don't taste so good
Sucks the jaws and they won't taste so good
I've seen your drugs and the don't look so good
Suck the jaws like I wish you would

[Trackname: Lover's Spit]

All these people drinking lover's spit
They sit around and clean their face with it
And they listen to teeth to learn how to quit
Tied to a night they never met
You know it's time that we
Grow old and do some shit
I like it all that way
I like it all that way

All these people drinking lover's spit
Swallowing words while giving head
They listen to teeth to learn how to quit
Take some hands and get used to it

All these people drinking lover's spit
They sit around and clean their face with it
You know it's time that we
Grow old and do some shit
I like it all that way
I like it all that way
I like it all that way

[Trackname: I'm Still Your Fag]

Heard about your wife and kids where we slept
Felt their mouths with stitches at that were slowly lit
Kept your uniform this time because I couldn't quit
Haven't felt the ground so cold without getting sick

And I'm still your fag
I'm still your fag

It's a possibility to live without lips
Clinics love to fill right up with all the broken kids
I swore I drank your piss that night to see if I could live
But my wrists couldn't stand the life that we missed

And I'm still your fag
I'm still your fag

You're only coming out 'cause you came back in
You're only coming out 'cause you came back in

And I'm still your fag
I'm still your fag
