[Trackname: Daniel]

Saw you making eyes at me
Hotels are loneliest
In little miss New Jersey
Back to work and on your feet

And oh, you're so far away
And God knows when
I'd ever get the chance
To touch your hands

You know we'll never date
Let alone be friends
You're so far away
It hurts so bad

Softly walk away from me
Goodbyes are loneliest
When you know we'll never meet
Face to face or feet to feet

And oh, you're so far away
And God knows when
I'd ever get the chance
To touch your hands
You know we'll never date
Let alone be friends
You're so far away
It hurts so bad
It hurts so bad
It hurts so bad

[Trackname: Stop]
Here in another land giving up all of my trials
Little did I think that you'd be doing the same for me
For me
Where this goes I'm trailing behind cause
I can't tell myself to stop
To stop to feel
Feel if I like it
I keep telling myself to stop
I hear it ringing
I keep telling myself to stop
Am I already with you oh what do we do now?
Some day it's all over
Will I remember the scenery then?
The stampede we will all part from
So close to my skeleton
Maybe it's foolish to wanna be alone
I keep telling myself to stop
To stop and feel
Feel if I like 

[Trackname: Bad Street]
Feel it with you, in you feel it
Feel it with you, in you feel it
Feel it with you, in you feel it
Feel it with you, feel it in you
Making a commotion
With you
Making a commotion
In you
Seeing all the glamour
In you
Seeing all the glamour
With you
(I want it bad...)
Feel it
With you
Feel it
In you
I want it bad...
Tell me a story something I can picture
(bad house, bad street)
Tell me a secret I won't tell anyone
(bad house, bad street)
Tell me whatever give me something to do
(bad house, bad street)
Make me a promise cause I
I want it bad...
(beep beep..)
(feel it)
Bad house
Bad street
Big hands
Big feet
Got a car
Beep beep
Bad boy
Bad streak
Three kids
Two kids
Got a job
Feeds three

[Trackname: Space Babe]
Time, taking its time
To land through the sky
I'd be there by now
To see where you live
If it were up to me
If it were up to me
If it were up to me
I'd never leave
To go, to not see
How you live here
Without me
If it were up to me
If it were up to me
If it were up to me
I'd never leave

[Trackname: Kimmi In a Rice Field]
At first the sky was empty
Kimmi's feet follow
The path to the edge
Near the road
A boy passes
Guiding his bike
He waves hello
Patiently, Kimmi waits
Patiently
Picking petals
Until the moon
Lifts itself to the sky
Stars come out
Kimmi rushes
To the edge
There she catches
Catches sight of her dead sister
With a grin, she's moaning, "beware of me"
Seedlings stirring towering over
Kimmi runs, the field is alive
It swallows her whole body, she fights
Dead alive, together
In their rice field, together

[Trackname: Luna's Theme]
Walk into my room, to talk
And I hear it in your voice that side, side of you
Sweet side of you
Words growing deary within, we all want
To see the sweet side of you
Sweet side of her

[Trackname: Spain]
The summer's come again
And you will leave us
Always leaving, me behind
I'll wait for you here
It's hard to choose the life you want
To throw up both your hands
To forget about everyone else
And decide which life is right for us
You seem to have made up your mind now
Growing further
When you are here
We know that you won't stay
I'll wait for you here
The summer's come again
It's hard to choose the life you want
To throw up both your hands
To forget about everyone else
And decide which life is right for us

Magic heart in a man

Can he steal every scene?

[Trackname: Saturday Sunday]
Saturday, what a day
Saturday, Sunday both of these days
Saturday, Sunday
Saturday, Sunday
Saturday, Sunday
Saturday, Sunday
Went to the marina
I saw a girl there with no shoes
She wore a bikini and she smiled at me and said
"Please could I come? My friends are no fun
They're out there lying in the sun
I don't care if I'm tan or I'm fair
Just wanna have a better time with you and with you"
Saturday, Sunday
Saturday, Sunday
Saturday, Sunday
Saturday, Sunday
Saturday
No Sunday
Saturday
No Sunday
She had a deep tan with a pretty full smile
She gave me the feeling just to hide away and run
Please give me tongue my life is no fun
My weekends are loveless and so dull
Saturday, Sunday
Both of these days are gone
Saturday, Sunday
Saturday, Sunday
Saturday, Sunday
Saturday, Sunday

[Trackname: Eastern Green]
All the money goes to a traveling way
There's little shock in a cabin train
Going overground through the I have knowns
Never nothing new
Eastern Green, navigation's clear
Warm thing, thicker and see through
There are maps on the wall
Geographic claims with no chart of wind
For the wide wide plains
Silver shuttle steam shuffling across
Shaking off a root
Eastern Green, feels me all the time
Something looking right through me
Eastern Green, feels me all the time
Something looking right through me
Something looking right through me
Someone's looking right through
