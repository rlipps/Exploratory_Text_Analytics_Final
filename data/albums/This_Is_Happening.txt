Walking up to me expecting
Walking up to me expecting words
It happens all the time
Present company excepted
Present company except the worst
It happens every night

Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company excluded every time
Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company, the best that you can find

Talking like a jerk
Except you are an actual jerk
And living proof that sometimes friends are mean
Present company expect it
Present company, just laugh it off
It's better than it seems

Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company excluded in every way
Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company, makes me wanna stay
Go
Killing it with close inspection
Killing it can only make it worse
It sort of makes it breed
Present company accepting
Presently we all expect the worst
It works just like a need

Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company excluded in the night
Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company included in the fight

Ah-ahhhhhhh
Ah-ah-ahhhh
Ahhhhh
Ah-ahhhh

Don't you want me to wake up
Then give me just a bit of your time
Arguments are made for make-ups
So give it just a little more time
We've got to bring the resources
I wanna play it 'til the time comes
Forget your string of divorces
You go and throw your little hands up
It's late
Oh
Honey, it's late
Oh

I miss the way the night goes
With friends who always make it feel good
This basement has a cold glow
Though it's better than a bunch of others

So go and dance yourself clean
Go and dance yourself clean
You're blowing Marxism to pieces
Their little arguments to pieces

It's your show
It's your show
It's your show
It's your show
It's your show...
Put your little feet down
And hang out
Every night's a different story
It's a thirty car pile-up with you
Everybody's getting younger
It's the end of an era, it's true

And you go
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop

Break me into bigger pieces
So some of me is home with you
Wait until the weekend
And we can make our bad dreams come true
And it's a-go
Yeah, it's a-go
And if we wait until the weekend
We can miss the best things to do

Go and dance yourself clean, ah
Go and dance yourself clean, yeah
And blow the Marxists into pieces
Their little arguments to pieces

We should try a little harder
In the tedious march of the few
Every day's a different warning
There's a part of me hoping it's 

[Trackname: Drunk Girls]

Drunk girls
Drunk girls
Drunk girls
Drunk girls

Drunk girls
Drunk girls cause a couple of heart attacks
Drunk girls
Drunk girls are unusually mild
Drunk boys
Drunk boys keep in pace with the pedophiles
Drunk girls
Drunk girls are boringly wild
Drunk girls
Drunk girls get invitations from nations
Drunk girls
They got the patience of a millions of saints
Drunk boys
They steal, they steal from the cupboards

Drunk girls like to file complaints

Drunk girls
Drunk girls are like a night of simplicity

They need a lover who is smarter than me
Well drunk boys
Drunk boys, we walk like pedestrians

Drunk girls know that love is an astronaut

It comes back, but it's never the same
Drunk boys
Drunk boys, drunk boys, drunk boys, drunk boys
(Drunk boys have such beautiful feelings)
Drunk girls
Drunk girls can be just as insane
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
So oh oh
That means making eyes across the room

Drunk girls
Just 'cause I'm shallow doesn't mean that I'm heartless
Drunk girls
Just 'cause I'm heartless doesn't mean that I'm mean but
Drunk boys
Sometimes love gives us too many options
Drunk girls
Just 'cause you're hungry doesn't mean that you're lean
Drunk girls
I've heard lies that could curdle your heartstrings
Drunk girls
A couple truths, maybe burn out your eyes but
Drunk boys
Drunk boys leave their irons in the fireplace
Drunk girls
'Cause drunk girls give them too many tries

Oh oh oh
I believe in making eyes across the room
(The day becomes the night)
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
(The day becomes the night)
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
(The day becomes the night)
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
(The day becomes the night)
But still, be honest with me, honestly, honestly
Unless it hurts my feelings!

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!


[Trackname: One Touch]

I don't think that we will be pleased with this
We have waited for a long time
I recall the promises made to us
We've been patient for a long time

One touch is never enough
You gave the opening, opening
One touch is never enough
People who need people, to the back of the bus

I don't see how we could be pleased with this
We've been waiting for a long time
I recall the promises made to us
We've been patient such a long time

No one is dangerous
We are not dangerous
Unless we get a closer view

One touch is never enough
People need to move to the back of the bus
One touch is never enough
Complicated people never do what you tell them to
One touch is never enough
People will be pushed in the back of the bus
One touch is never enough
People who need people
Are just people who need people

One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
People who need people
Are just people who need people

I don't think that we will be pleased with this
We have waited such a long time
There's no way that we can be pleased with this
We've been waiting such a long time
We've been waiting such a long time
We've been waiting such a long time
This is getting sort of unreasonable
But we will wait a very long time

One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
People who need people, to the back of the bus
No one is dangerous
No one is dangerous
Until we get a closer 

[Trackname: All I Want]

Wait for the day you come home from the lonely part
Look for the girl who has put up with all of your shit
You've never needed anyone for so long

You learn in your bed
You've been gone for too long
To put in the time
But it's too late to make it strong

Now all I want is your pity
Or all I want is your bitter tears
Yeah, all I want is your pity
Or at least all I want are your bitter tears
All I want is your pity
Oh all I want are your bitter tears
Yeah, all I want is your pity
Oh all I want are your bitter tears

Wake with a start
And the dog and the girl are gone
So you pack up your things
And head into the lame unknown
You never had needed anything for so long
And now all I want is your pity
And all I want are your bitter tears
Now all I want is your pity
And all I want are your bitter tears

From now on, I'm someone different
'Cause it's no fun to be predictably lame
From now on, let's do it different
'Cause I just want what I want
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me 

[Trackname: I Can Change]

Tell me a line, make it easy for me
Open your arms
Dance with me until I feel all right
It's good in the dark, good in the dark
But into the lover's light
Here comes another fight
So ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Bore me and hold me and cling to my arm
Here it comes, here it comes
And what you're asking me now, disastrous now
Hoping and hoping and hoping
The feeling goes away

Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
This is why I fell in love
Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
That's just who I fell in love with
(in love...)

Oh this is the time, the very best time
So give me a line and take me home
Take me over
But dashing the hopes dashing the hopes
And smashing the pride
The morning's got you on the ropes
And love is a murderer, love is a murderer
But if she calls you tonight
Everything is all right
Yeah, we know
And love is a curse shoved in a hearse
Love is an open book to a verse of your bad poetry
And this is coming from me
But I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(Fall in love)
But I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in love)

Turn on the light, make it easy for me
Feel the divide, fumble in the kitchen
'Til it's right
What an awful sight
But there's love in your eyes
Love in your eyes, love in your eyes
But maybe that's just your love of fights
All night!

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in love)
And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(In love)
And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you feel real love
(In love)
And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(In love)

[Trackname: You Wanted a Hit]

You wanted a hit
But maybe we don't do hits
I try and try
It ends up feeling kind of wrong
You wanted it tough
But is it ever tough enough?
No, nothing's ever tough enough
Until we hit the road

Yeah, you wanted it lush
But honestly, you must hush
No, honestly, you know too much
So leave us, leave us on our own
And so you wanted a hit
Well this is how we do hits
You wanted a hit
But that's not what we do

You wanted it real
But can you tell me what's real?
There's lights and sounds and stories
Music's just a part
Yeah, you wanted the truth
And then you said you want proof
I guess you're used to liars
Saying what they want
And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies 'til you take us home
No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies 'til you take us home

Yeah you wanted it smart
But honestly, I'm not smart
No, honestly, we're never smart
We fake it, fake it all the time
Yeah you wanted the time
But maybe I can't do time
Oh we both know that's an awful line
But it doesn't make it wrong

You wanted it right
No out of mine and out of sight
No dirty bus and early flight
No seven days and forty nights
Yeah you wanted a hit
But tell me, where's the point in it?
You wanted a hit
But that's not what we do
And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies 'til you take us home
No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies 'til you take us home
And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies 'til you take us home
No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies 'til you take us 

[Trackname: Pow Pow]

From this position
I will relax
From this position
I can see the whole place
From this position
Oh, oh just relax
From this position
I make some stand
I make my peace with the man

And it goes pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
It goes pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow

From this position
I can see both of them
From this position
I totally get how the decision was reached
From this position
I can say "serious," or "cop-out," or "hard to define"
From this position, from this position
It's kind of like eating myself to death
With you on the outside
And me on the inside
There's advantages to both
(Advantages to both!)
And me being uptight
And you being all right
There's advantages to each
(Advantages! Advantages!)

From this perspective, from this position
I have a good grip on both of them
Because I have stayed home
And have learned a little more about my neighbourhood
Which is important
You know, there's a lot of good places to eat

So it goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
So it's pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
It goes pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
With you on the keystroke
And me on the gangplank
There's advantages to both
(Advantages to both)
And you have been all right
And I have been filmed being ridiculous
Oh, eat it, Michael Musto
(You're no Bruce Vilanch!)
Now I have been untied
And you are all cross-eyed
There's advantages to each
(Advantages to each)
And I'm coming back, coming back, coming back
Until there's nothing left in the well
Is that what they call it, the well?

I'm paralyzed
And looking through you
But if nothing's right
We try anyway
As a compromised, aggregate person
I'm amazed at my decision to play

On this occasion, there are a couple of things that we know that we pulled from Fact Magazine
One, the king wears a king hat and lives in a king house
Two, your time will come, but tonight is our night
So you should give us all of your drugs
Three, we have a black president and you do not, so shut up, because you don't know shit about where I'm from that you didn't get from TV
So times have been tough
And times have been tough
You have been put down, washed up, and rinsed out
But honestly
And be honest with yourself
How much time do you waste?
How much time do you blow every day?
And so it's pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Oh, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
So pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
(The return of the police!)
(The return of the police)

With you on the inside
And me on the outside
There's advantages to both
(Advantages to both!)
With me being wired
And you being tired
There's advantages to each
(Advantages! Advantages!)

From this position
I feel an affinity for the both of them, which is confusing
But honestly
I should be careful because otherwise, I'm being, I'm being, you know, what's it called?
Oh, fuck it
Reclining, I'm getting used to it
Like kissing under a bridge
It's an entirely new
Discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery
And then a couple of weeks at home
And then a couple of weeks away
And then home and away, again
To use up your desire for
Discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery

For an instant
You could have pushed through
But it's a plagiarized
Regret anyway
But what you want for now
Is someone to feel you
And that's the thing you like
Is planning to stay
And all this time
It's so nice
It's so nice
It's so nice
(The return of the police!)

[Trackname: Somebody's Calling Me]
Somebody's calling me to be my girl
Somebody's calling me to be my girl
But my hands don't work when I'm on my feet
And I wake up cold - going back to sleep
Babe, come with me
And I'll take you to the place I sleep
Oh, darling, come with me
And I'll show you the place I sleep
Somebody's phoning me to be my girl
Somebody's phoning me to be my girl
But the phone won't ring when I'm on the street
And my heart won't beat when I'm half asleep
Somebody's texting me to be my girl
Constantly texting me to be my girl
But the text won't take when the night's a creep
And my mouth don't move when I'm in too deep
Babe, come with me
And I'll take you to the place I sleep
Oh, darling, come with me
And I'll show you the place I sleep
All right
Somebody's pulling me into their world
Wrapped up and full of good inside their world
But the car won't start when I'm half asleep
And the kids don't cry when you're on your feet
Babe, come with me
And I'll show you the place I sleep
Oh, darling, come with me
And I'll take you to the place I live
The place I live
The place I live
The place I live
This is where I live

[Trackname: Home]
Home
Home
Home
Home
Home
Home
Take me home
Just do it right
Make it perfect and real
Because it's everything
Though everything was never the deal
So grab your things and stumble into the night
So we can shut the door
And shut the door on terrible times, oh
Yeah, do it right
And head again into space
So you can carry on
And carry on, and fall all over the place
This is the trick, forget a terrible year
That we can break the laws
Until it gets weird
And this is what you waited for
But under lights, we're all unsure
And so tell me
What would make you feel better?
As night has such a local ring
And love and rock are fickle things
And you know it
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Take it
Forget your past
This is your last chance now
And we can break the rules
Like nothing will last
You might forget
Forget the sound of a voice
Still,​ you should not forget
Yeah, don't forget
The things that we laughed about
And after rolling on the floor
And thankfully, a few make sure that you get home
And you stay home
And you're better
'Cause you're afraid of what you need
Yeah, you're afraid of what you need
If you weren't, if you weren't
I don't know what we'd talk about
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Yeah, no one ever knows what you're talking about
So I guess you're already there
No one opens up when you scream and shout
But it's time to make a couple things clear
If you're afraid of what you need
If you're afraid of what you need
Look around you, you're surrounded
It won't get any better
And so,
