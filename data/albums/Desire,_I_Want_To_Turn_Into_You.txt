I am my father's daughter in the end
He says, "Watch your ego, watch your head, girl
You're so smart, so talented
But now the water's turning red
And it's all your fault and it's all your mess
And you're all alone and can't go to bed
Too high on your adrenaline
You gotta go somewhere where you can't pretend
Go forget the rules, forget your friends
Just you and your reflection
'Cause nothing's gonna be the same again
No, nothing's gonna be the same again"

Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Float on (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
The ocean blue
Float on (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Time's running out, innit?
Pity the mayflies in the swimming pool at dawn
But down in the deep end, I can't be left alone
Sweet Eliza's on the court
Potential is the drug they never knew you never tried
But you see it in my eyes and that is, bae
Threading the needle, pretty in possible
If only to get me out the door
Oracle and Odyssey with the bloody nose
If I'm on your street, you'll be the last to know
That I get dizzy, dizzy and I cannot afford that kind of

Now you got one eyе on the lane and one еye on the lava
Spinning out, yeah, I respect that, but I was born to get you home
Home, where it's all red and velveteen
Falling back into the leaves
So true, with your lipstick on my thigh
Drink the tears until they dry

Dirty like it's Earth Day
Tryna whet that palette
Can you cut that check?
Crush that wreck?
Run out empty on 'em?
AWOL on a Thursday
Tryna go ask Alice
Tryna catch that rabbit

[Trackname: Sunset]

These days, I wear my body like an uninvited guest
I turn it right and right and right instead of turning left
But, boy, your patience is a magic kind of medicine
'Cause every spiral brings me back into your arms again

So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset, fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms, a warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away, let's ride away

(Hey)

So many stories we were told about a safety net (Hey)
But when I look for it, it's just a hand that's holding mine
I'm wearing black to mourn thе sudden loss of innocence
And that's alright bеcause it hides the dirt and hides the wine

So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset, fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms, a warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away, let's ride away
(Hey)
(Hey)

No regrets
'Cause you're my sunset, fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms, a warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away, let's ride 

[Trackname: Crude Drawing Of An Angel]

Draw the blinds, draw the bath
It's a matter of time 'til you wake up and watch me
Draw your brow with shaky hand
So that after you're gone, I got something to hold onto (Red light)
Oh, my fault (Camera one, camera two)
Oh, my greed (On your side, on the carpet)
Oh, your need (Camera one, camera two)

Angel, I'd hold you down
Forsake me here on the ground
All or nothing

Draw your blood, draw your breath
Skip the whites of your eyes 'til you wake up and watch me
Draw your wings from your back
I'll not be shy, no, I'll not be gentle with you (Red light)

Oh, my fault (Camera one, camera two)
Oh, my greed (On your side, on thе carpet)
Oh, your need (Camera one, camеra two)
Angel, I'd hold you down
Forsake me here on the ground
All or nothing
All or 

[Trackname: I Believe]

Look over the edge, but not too far

You're not alone
Under a sky of vultures
With all that could've been
You made it home
With silver string unbroken
Ain't that the sweetest gift?

Oh, little miracle, swing low
Where there can be no compromises down low

I don't know, but I believe
We'll get another day together
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh
No, I don't know, but I believe

And I'd have said it was impossible
To find you in this life and keep you just enough

Oh, littlе miracle, swing low
Where thеre can be no compromises down low
I don't know, but I believe
We'll get another day together
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh
No, I don't know, but I believe

Look over the edge, but not too far
Look over the edge, but not too far

I don't know, but I believe
We'll get another day together
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh
No, I don't know, but I believe

Violent love
Feel my embrace
Look over the edge, but not too far
But not too 

[Trackname: Fly To You (feat. Grimes and Dido)]

Come mi ricordo, come mi dimentico
Volvevo odiarti ma invece ti amo
La violenza alla fine mi ha reso gentile
Più vicina e vicina e vicina a te
Tesoro, sto morendo dalla voglia di scoprire

(Hey) Uh, volo da te
(Hey) Dopo tutte le lacrime, sei tutto ciò che mi serve (Hey)
Volo da te (Woo)
Non da qualunque parte, nel profondo dentro di me (Hey)

Ah, ah (Hey)
Ah, ah (Hey)
Ah, ah (Woo)
Ah

Guidando attraverso il buio
Persa ma sono libera
Sto cercando qualcosa
Che nessun altro può vedere
Mi amerai ancora
Dopo la curva?
Ricorda cos'è successo prima
Non pieno di rimorso
(Hey) Uh, volo da te
(Hey) Dopo tutte le lacrime, sei tutto ciò che mi serve (Hey)
Volo da te (Woo)
Non da qualunque parte, nel profondo dentro di me (Hey)

(Hey)

Mm, volo da te
Dopo tutte le lacrime, sei tutto ciò che mi serve
Volo da te
Non da qualunque parte nel profondo dentro di me

Volo da te (Come mi dimentico)

Non da qualunque parte nel profondo dentro di me (Tesoro, sto morendo dalla voglia di scoprire)

Sto cercando qualcosa
Che nessun altro può vedere
Ricorda cos'è successo prima
Non pieno di rimorso

[Trackname: Blood And Butter]

Look at you in denim and bows
I know the mode, the mode is lethal
Say you wanna show me a place
The place is here, the here is inside you
Where did you come from, you?

Pretty with the critical mass
Your body has the body power
Lying at the foot of a linden
In a navel ring inventing June
Where did you come from, you?

And what I want is
To walk beside you
Needing nothing
But the sun that's in our eyes
Paint the picture
In blood and butter
Holy water
Fire in the sky

Lеt me dive
Through your face
To thе sweetest kind of pain
Call you up
Nothing to say
No, I don't need no entertaining
When the world
Is a bed
Give me green and ribbon red
Oh, I get
Closer than your new tattoo
Look at you all mythicalogical
And Wikipediated
Look how I forget who I was
Before I was the way I am with you
Where did you come from, you?

And what I want is
To walk beside you
Needing nothing
But the sun that's in our eyes
Paint the picture
In blood and butter
Holy water
Fire in the sky

Let me dive
Through your face
To the sweetest kind of pain
Call you up
Nothin' to say
No, I don't need no entertaining
When the world
Is a bed
Give me green and ribbon red
Oh, I get
Closer than your new tattoo
Closer than 

[Trackname: Hopedrunk Everasking]

Starlight in the tunnel
Kind of familiar
Hopedrunk everasking
How does it feel to know
Your final form?
So old, so new

Pull close to me and never be alone

Real life is a rumor
Under the theatre
Deeper, dig it deeper
'Til the meanwhile slows
They'll find our bones
And yet they won't

Pull close to me and never be alone

Dawn is just a headspace
Night is a feeling
Hopedrunk everasking
Centuries come and go
Thеy'll find our bones
And yet they won't

[Trackname: Butterfly Net]

Earth went silent
London fell asleep
She dreamed of winter
Where you appeared to me
Perfect timing as new petals in November
A tender creature
A fever
Disarming, fluorescent

There you were
With your mirror
Shining the world all over me
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

I collected
Stupid ashes
So that after you'd gone
I could hold onto something
But you stayed unwavering
Through every false goodbye
Unsubsiding
Pining
For now and for never
There you were
With your mirror
Shining the world all over me
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

Oh, if only
The umbrella of the sky
Could wrap us up and up
That's where I'd zoom in close
Dilated as your eyes
Until then, I'll keep it brief

Faithful inertia
Her bullet doesn't slow
It seeks and finds me
How far it goes
Heaven help me
Take this bag of wings
And drown it in the Thames
And wake tomorrow
Hollow
Hardly forgetting
There you were
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your

And you are the big answer tonight
And you are melting everything about me
Oh, don't worry about me, it's just smoke

And the fallout doesn't faze me
Take a bullet for my baby
For the one thing that'll save me, I know, mmh
Throw it all out and replace it
With a brand new kind of crazy
Don't believe it when you praise me, do I? Mmh
