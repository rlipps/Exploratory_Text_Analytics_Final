[Trackname: I Sit On the Ridge At Dusk]
I sit on the ridge at dusk
As the light leaves the valley by rising
Trees' fingers clutch at it
Vainly sifting the light and dying
So bleed sarcophagi romantically
Replete with dignifying reconstructive makeup
Chorus:
Ga da wuor la trubae lune

[Trackname: But In the Headlights]
But in the headlights of those all heading home
All turned on as night came:
And flowing as a stream of bonding, unbonding molecules
Their light came
A highway arcs across my hill
Come out as dusk came down on it
The day hid it in soft dead leaves

[Trackname: Warholian Wigs]
With a longing upward and out
To meet those rosy slopes
And explode into them
Before they erode
The failing time flattens out
Like the optimism of old
Whose tribulation has become rosy
My star could crest
Parabolic
Over the etched stream
And its etching

[Trackname: I Will Truck]
I will truck faster than the world revolves
I will jet spirals 'round the leaves as they fall
Around the leaves as they fall
Eh leve wual speh hey raal don aon on
I'll turn faster than they in their season
I'll turn faster, I'll turn faster
In revolving it changes
And I don't trust the axis or the allies
Eh leve wual speh hey raal don aon 

[Trackname: D. Henley's Dream]
There's a lake of black gold
There's an island, place of my great battle
There's an eagle and a snake
Graceful your evasions
That allow me pursuit
I love

[Trackname: Gilt Gold Scabs]
They wear their leaves like Warholian wigs
Kangarwomb
If she had not paved
In memoriam their wounds
With gilt gold scabs
I dream of resting
Kangarwomb

[Trackname: Ponds & Puddles]
I am a ex-centripetal
And weary from wandering
Pondering what I could mean
Staring into ponds and puddles
When the mud muddles my vision clean
Made clear by the rippling
I am a ex-centripetal
And weary from wandering
Pondering what I could mean
Staring into ponds and puddles

[Trackname: Not Having Found]
Maybe the truth in searching
Is not having found

[Trackname: Tour Along the Potomac]
I will be for you
A tour guide around the fields this afternoon
The field of battle lies along the riverside
Between two ridges and a cluster of low hills
Please remember:
Battlefields aren't picked out by choice or favor
It might be tough to see that, not so distantly
This field was theatre to a great and might way

[Trackname: Jolly Jolly Jolly Ego]
Jolly jolly jolly ego
You fit in
You fit in, jolly, jolly, jolly
Let the water bead
Off your naked shoulders
Clung to obstinate
Like an old love letter
Boxed in her back pocket
Lacking lust, or living saliva
Dried blood - like a wax seal, scabbing regal

[Trackname: Time Birthed Spilled Blood]
Time birthed spilled blood
For to mine as oil yours
We will settle here
On the plain
This be our island

[Trackname: Drilling Profitably]
May we all benefit from the legacy of the fallen
Petrified, pressed, minted for profit
Ad this will be our final stop
I want to guide you toward the gift shop
Thank you all for being so pleasant

[Trackname: Finches' Song At Oceanic Parking Lot]
Who is the searcher?
Who is the colonist?
In time, you will know
The last Wilderness
Who is the searcher?
Who is the colonist?
In time, you will know
The last Wilderness
So may you restful be
In time, in time
Do not colonize the insides
The insides
Who is the searcher?
Who is the colonist?
In time, you will know
The last Wilderness
Who is the searcher?
Who is the colonist?
In time, you will know
The last Wilderness
