[Trackname: Pendulum]
You're the cat's eyes
You're the pendulum
When the orator says
It's your time, you're the one
All the natives say
You know it's your time, you're the one
Little fears, little fears
Whispered in rabbits' ears
But now you're gonna swing like a pendulum
In your mind's eye
You see pentacles
Fortune tellers say
It's your time, you're the one
And your wife, she says
It's your time, you're the one
Little fears, little fears
Whispered in rabbits' ears
And now you're gonna swing like a pendulum
Little fears, little fears
Whispered in rabbits' ears
And now you're gonna swing like a pendulum
It's your face in the mirror
Hasn't changed through the years
And all you do is swing like a pendulum
You're hollow, oh oh
So hollow, 

[Trackname: Dream the Dare]
Tell me golden ocean love
Hopeless but adored
Sea-slick symboled wants for more
He draws the Raven’s card
Give me forward motion love
Seas of white unfold
Sky’s black servant divinate
Show us what you hold
Window watcher I want ya come on
Oh love are you mine
Those feathered lashes you’re hiding behind
Does it catch in your chest?
Do you like what you find?
Don’t you know I think about it all of the time
Diamond islands in your eyes
Blackest in the sun
Ancient watcher divinate
You’re the only one
Window watcher i want ya come on
Oh love are you mine
Those feathered lashes you’re hiding behind
Does it catch in your chest?
Do you like what you find?
Don’t you know I think about it all of the time
Window watcher I want ya come on
Oh love are you kind
Those withered words that ring in your mind
Does it catch in your chest
Do you like what you find
Window watcher I want ya
To feel water
To feel fire
To feel water
Window watcher I want ya come on a
Oh love are you mine
Those feathered lashes you’re hiding behind
Does it catch in your chest?
Do you like what you find?
Window watcher I want ya, come down and be mine
Little watcher come closer I need ya
Oh love are you kind
Those withered words that ring in your mind
Does it catch in your chest
Do you like what you see
Is it all what you want it, want it to be
Come down storm crow, from your window
Come down storm crow, find your way 

[Trackname: Evergreener]
Earthly keeper, wise in the wonder
Are your ring now, forest deeper
Evergreener
No one follows as you wander down
Death bestows the leaves
Underneath those trees
Folded golden shores where you were born
Fading further colors you adore
Folded golden shores where you were born
So much older, bolder and more
While in winter, summer's lovers
You remember, as you're walking
Evergreener
No one follows as you wander down
Violets turn to snow
But you already know
Folded golden shores where you were born
Fading further colors you adore
Folded golden shores where you were born
So much older, bolder and more

[Trackname: Twins]
Body electric
Disconnected
Slow my love goes
Into shadows through the hollows
Lonely echos your name
They cry and cry
If I could go back and find you
I would I'd safely hide you
Twins, our bodies keep us so warm
Rings, wrapped around our forearms
Bodies electric
So disconnected
Slow my love grows
Into shadows through the hollows
Lonely echos my mind
They cry and cry
If I could go back and find you
I would I'd safely hide you far from
Those things that haunt you, and my heart
Would be inside you
Twins, our bodies keep us so warm
Rings, wrapped around our forearms
Twins, our bodies keep us so warm
Rings, wrapped around our forearm

[Trackname: Only Lonely Lovers]
Emerald’s green between us
Envied ivyed overgrown
Holy old reprises crystallize us
Lonely lovers left below
Two peaks deeply distant
We came crimson crying overgrown
Holy old reprises as we go
Leading lonely lovers home
I remember feathered lashes hiding eyes wise fateful no more
Homesick, my heart beats black
Holding hopeless hollow love for the one i adore
The green ghosted vision
Scales in the isle storms that blow
Holy old reprises crystallize us
Lonely lovers left below
I remember feathered lashes hiding eyes wise fateful no more
Homesick, my heart beats black
Holding hopeless hollow love for the one I adore
Love me tender I remember fading lights last lit from the door
Homesick, my heart beats black
Only lonely lovers know what the hopeless adore
Only lonely lovers know

[Trackname: Scotty]
Now you move so smooth
It's all new inside you
Spins that rhythm
You let push through
Rows to rows, mile to mile
Gaze is fixed, eyes on fire
Something secret sleeps deep
Inside
It's your natural place
You stay
Scotty's got his way, yeah
And you laugh in their faces
You say, "Scotty's got to stay", yeah
They blink once, they blink twice
Seen it all, hearts like ice
Something secret sleeps deep
Within you
It's your natural place
You stay
Scotty's got his way, yeah
And you laugh in their faces
You say, "Scotty's got to stay", yeah
It's your natural place
And you laugh in their faces
It's your natural place
You stay
Scotty's got his way, yeah
You laugh in their faces
You say...
(If I could fly, I'd pick you up)
It's your natural place
(I'd take you into the night)
You stay
(And show you love)
Scotty's got his way, yeah
(If I could fly, I'd pick you up)
You laugh in their faces
(I'd take you into the night)
You say...
(And show you love)
Scotty's got to stay, yeah

[Trackname: Temples of the Moon]
In that small divide
Silvered banks on either side
Under water
Light in all design
Crescent, carved of stars of night
All I wanted
{Vocalisation]
Compass never lies
Never north and south combined
In my pocket
Temples beyond the tides
This is where the moon resides
Under water
{Vocalisation]
I have seen your light
Crescent lady in the night
As I've wandered
Sliver to a sphere
Do you whispеr in my ear
Under water
I havе seen your light
Crescent lady in the night
As I’ve wandered
Sliver to a sphere
Do you whisper in my ear
Under water
