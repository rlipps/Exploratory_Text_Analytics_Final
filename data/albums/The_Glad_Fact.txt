[Trackname: The Glad Fact]
But here I go again
Well here I go again
Here I go again
Well here I go again
Well here I go again
Here I go again
Now I enter the season of summer
Tired and not really feeling
And I am like the begrudgingly awakened
For whom the sun is here to spite
And all my attempts at living
Just like all of my feelings for girls
Since you
Have been fainthearted and ambivalent
Paralyzing
But here I go again
Well here I go again
Here I go again
Well here I go again
Well here I go again
Here I go 

[Trackname: My Offwhite Flag]
I copped a feel
Of the wall
Trying to find the light switch in the dark
Then I got into bed and fell at last asleep, quickly
It's been awhile since I played the game
I've been retired since Saturday
From the first base line I watched those blondes
So perfectly flirting
And I held my off-white flag between my knees
Limply
It's been awhile since I played the game
I've been retired since Saturday
I am a child
And I'm not ready
It's been awhile since I played the game
I've been retired since Saturday
I am a child
And I'm not 

[Trackname: Like Fake Blood In Crisp October]
The new feelings will rise up like fake blood in crisp October
From the cracks and the edges of the graves of our proudest moments
Because that's not a monument, it's a grave
The new feelings will probably be buried here too
But I swear they'll be born elsewhere
The new feelings will rise up like fake blood in crisp October
From the cracks and the edges of the graves of our proudest moments
Because that's not a monument, it's a grave

[Trackname: Boredome Is a Product]
Boredom is a product is a product of mistrust
Mistrust of the products of your own brain
Inventing the human
Release all into space

[Trackname: Two Brown Finches]
Like two brown finches, talk-talking away
Gone is the afternoon, and what did we say?
Lik two brown finches, chirp-chirp-chirp-chirping away
Gone is the afternoon, and what did we say? (Not a lot)
And we drank a two liter of Orange Crush
Yea we drank a two liter of Orange Crush
Said we drank a two liter of Orange 

[Trackname: Three Brown Finches]
Three blocks west
At the edge of the lot
Three brown finches know a special spot
Feathers ruffled
Slender throats
There is no wind there
When we kicked a box down the empty road
And felt like insects in a scale model
Three brown finches knew where we were going
Those three brown finches
In comes the summer in a week of rain
Put it in your pocket all is living again
Here comes the summer
Here comes the summer
Here comes the summer

[Trackname: Off Science Hill]
Off Science Hill is a fenced off lot
Your classic parking lot at the end of time
And off science hill is where I took a walk
And I heard the finches and their empty talk
Pavement turned into meadow and video tape tumbleweeds
And in the corner, like a dinosaur bone
The huge torso of a street lamp
Off Science Hill is where I took a walk
I heard the finches and their empty talk
Off Science Hill is where I took a walk
And I heard the finches in their empty talk
Pavement turned into meadow
And video tape tumbleweeds
And in the corner
There are elements in this day, in the day of Miami
Go forth, find them in tank top
Go forth searchin' in flip flops

[Trackname: Winter Is Here]
Worlds collide and conquer
Annihilating each other
Only one is victory
And neither of them are it
Only maybe I saw you just the other day
And I inherited my father's sense of dread
When it's been a long time gone
I wonder whether
Is it coming back?
Is it coming back?
A crazy man will cut his hands
And let them writhe like fish
Only maybe he'll forget
What he is staring at
Maybe did you see a bear
When it's been a long time gone
I wonder whether
Is it coming back?
Is this coming back?
I wonder whether is-
Is it coming back?
Is it coming back?
Is it coming back?
Is it coming back?

[Trackname: Ground Underfoot]
You didn't say what you meant
How should I have known it?
If not for ground underfoot
I might have laid my back in it
I might have laid my back in it
For long I lay asunder
And the notices of the board
Under which you suffer
When
I escape Tuesday
There will not be an email
There will not be a phone call
When
Distracted by the Orwell
Then I'll be gone
And all will be well
Yeah, all is going to be 

[Trackname: Spirit-Future Medley]
"Can they break my spirit?"
Spiro Agnew said that
But I am also saying that
Yes, I am also saying that
I am also saying that
Can they break my spirit?"
Spiro Agnew said that
But I am also saying it
I am also saying that
I am also saying that
Saying that
When the future comes
Nudging me awake
I will look into its eyes
I will remove the socks from its feet
I will caress softly, comely breasts
And we will quickly fall asleep
Though her intent was me to wake

[Trackname: Naked We Made It]

We laid on the roof, looked at stars till two
And we talked about the news
Wasn't too much news, so we went down soon
To the darkness of my room

And naked we made us two
And I loved it, I loved it, I loved it, I loved it
And naked we made us two
And I loved it, I loved it, I loved it, I loved it

Now the moon's waning, and the summer's fade
And you've emailed me
Oblique, oblique, milky transparency
Let it be the time that we

We're naked, we made us two
And I loved it, I loved it, I loved it, I loved it
I loved it, I loved it, I loved it, I loved it
She loved it, I think she loved it

[Trackname: Lit from Below]
The trees lit from below look like the face of those telling ghost stories
This one talks about the big bang
Those clustered over there talk Manhattan in eager even tones
We'll content ourselves on ham and cheese
Sit in silence and agree with the breeze

[Trackname: Imaginary Love]
My love
Won't you talk to me
Won't you lay with me

My love
Won't you talk to me
Won't you lay with me
With me
With me

[Trackname: The Highway Is a Foggy Knife]
The highway is a foggy knife
Through nighttime hills I stand flickering
At my brother's side
And he says words I want to hold
Seventh-day Adventists collide
Cry soft in the night, metamorphose
If she sounds like you
She's your daughter
Wobbling in gray with sweaty palms
You shall be released, you shall be released

[Trackname: The Minutes]
The more minutes I live
The less I can account for
The minutes I lived
The minutes I lived
The more minutes I live
The less I can account for
The minutes I lived
The minutes I lived
And the more there is to say
The fewer the ways
And the more ways of understanding
As many as sand grains or land waves
I live
The less I can account for
The minutes I lived
The minutes I lived
The minutes I lived
The minutes I lived
