Well, I got shot right in the back
And you were there, you were there
I said I was never coming back
And you were there, you were there
Well I know the eyelids are under attack
You were there, you were there
Well, it's like the pressure wants to retract
Because you were there, you were there

And if God is what they made
Cut their hands off believers
Don't get high on what you create

Well, I saw Gaza turn into light
And you were there, you were there
All the subtractions made it on time
Because you were there, you were there
Well, all the nice boys wait for a sign
You were there, you were there
When I was out on the town, the town
And I needed it, needed it

And if love is what they gave
Turn wives into healers
Don't get high on what you create
Or it might just steal ya

[Trackname: 7/4 (Shoreline)]

It's a shoreline
And it's half speed
It's a cruel world
And it's time

And you're walking away
But where to go to?
And you're walking alone
But how to get through?
If you want to get it all
You can own what you choose
But you want to live a lie
And love what you lose

It's a shoreline
And it's high speed
It's a cruel world
And it's time

While you're walking away
And I'm try to get through
But you've got to know the lies
From the lies they told you
If you try to do it all
It all will leave you
If you try to steal the beat
The beat will steal you
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in

It's a shoreline
And it's half speed
It's a cruel world
And it's time

It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard

[Trackname: Major Label Debut]

I'm just coming here to come down
I could be here, I could move town
Put my suits right on the guest list
Sign my passport, became weightless

And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up

Draper street caught me believing
Spilt their eyes on all the ceilings
Forced to live like it's a curfew
Translation: it means I love you

And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up

I'm just coming here to come down
I could be here, I could move town
Forced to live like it's a curfew
Translation: it means I love you
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up

[Trackname: Fire Eye'd Boy]

Until the day you die
You always admit
You were right
You were right
About all of it

Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
If you're going to come, you better make it quick
Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip

Until the day I die
Columbia I blame
Brought us back
Back to life
Drifted off again

Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
If you're going to come, you better make it quick
Fire eyed boy gets his ass whipped

Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
If you're going to come, you better make it quick
Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
Fire eyed boy gave them all the slip
If you're going to come, you better make it quick
Fire eyed boy gets his ass whipped

All they want is to feel it
All they want is to feel it
All they want is to feel it
All they want is to feel it

(mumbling)
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)

All they want is to feel it
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
All they want is to feel it
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
All they want is to feel it
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
All they want is to feel it
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)

(mumbling)
All they want is to feel it
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
All they want is to feel it

(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
All they want is to feel it

(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
All they want is to feel it
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)

All they want is to feel it

Pull it close, pull it closer, I play it close
Head-to-toes tonight, recognizing the ghost
And the machine getting in between the thought and the finger
At the brink of an evolution, we're going to linger
Come on!
(Oh no! Oh no! oh no!)
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)

Gimme more of that beat

[Trackname: Swimmers]

I was
Waiting for you
I was
Standing around
I was
Getting older
I was
Going down

If you always get up late, you'll never be on time
If you always make it after work
Ba ba dadada
After work

Oh, the day never comes
And I stand up
Waiting on
I saw you down there, I know you were tired
I saw you, you looked like a swimmer

I want to be with you
All of the time
Why can't you satisfy?
You look good
But you sound better
You were the best I had
If you always get up late, you're never going to be on time
If you always get up late, you're never going to be on time
And that's a shame
Because I like you
I never see you

[Trackname: Hotel]

(Check in)

Disappear like I come in your world
Five is a number that I dream about
It looks like it could've been time
But that is a word that I dream about

Oh, felt good to fall life down
Oh, I think you like it, laughed when you came down
Oh, I love the lights that don't turn you to face it
Oh, you can marry my mom but
But you can't get the feel

Hotel

Disappear like a corner in the wall
Five is a number that I dream about
Sleep looks like a mescaline sun
But calm is a word that I dream about

Oh, felt good to fall life down
Oh, I think you like it, laughed when you came down
Oh, I love the lights that don't turn you to face it
Oh, you can marry my mom but
But you can't get the feel
Hotel
Hotel


[Trackname: Handjobs For The Holidays]

Let me take you on
We'll get high just a little
Try to surface the calm
We don't come inside

Has it brought you closer to this?
Yeah, has it brought you closer to this?

And is it coming alive?
Try to believe it
Was the question a point?
I don't want your love

Has it brought you closer to this?
Yeah, has it brought you closer to this?

We've got eyes that leave us in places we don't see
We've got eyes that leave us in places we don't see

Let me take you on
We'll get high just a little
It kind of takes the joy away
We don't come at all


[Trackname: Superconnected]

Does it come in cages? Does it come in threes?
I'm tripping on all the time, I'm tripping on high seas
Never the car ride and never the key
I've always been failing but not on my knees
And you want to believe it and you wanna conceive
There's a different suggestion I know that I'll believe
And you want to fuck this right between the knees
Get a little bit bloody, what does it have to do with me?

But I really don't want to think about those things anymore
No, I really don't want to think about those things
I really don't want to think about those things anymore
And I don't really think about those things

There's a section for babies, was it making believe?
They get you like creature's cocks, get you like creature's creeds
I've never been sailing, not unless it's the sea
A typical lazy eye staring for you and me
And you want to collect it and you want to conceive
Get it all connected with you and you and me
And I love the darkness, it's what happened to me
I was talking about stuff I cannot believe
I really don't want to think about those things anymore
I really don't want to think about those things
I really don't want to think about those things anymore
And I don't want to think about those things
I really don't want to think about those things anymore
I really don't want to think about those things
I really don't want to think about those things anymore
I don't really think about those things

This is superconnected, it's time to leave
This is superconnected, it's time to leave
This is superconnected

[Trackname: Bandwitch]
Put the little kids in the corner
With their face and their eyes on the floor
Put the little kids in the corner
With their face and their eyes on the floor
My favorite band
Is a witch
Find themselves in poet corners
And they still like to dick
It's of course, they're afraid
It's a fine complicate
You can find, demonstrate
Slip along, demon ways
My favorite band
Is a witch
Find themselves with perfect mornings
And they still try to live
The menstruation
Pulitzer Prize masturbation
A little morning cries
I wish on thievery of corners
Admit the cries
I know he's saying
He's saying, "so tired"
They'll have to put the little kids in the corner
With their eyes and face on the floor
You're so fucked up now
You're fucked up now
You're fucked up now
Put the little kids in the corner
With their face and their eyes on the floor
Put the little kids in the corner
With their face and their eyes on the floor
I know you want me to keep on going
You want me to keep on going
And you know wherever I am

[Trackname: It's All Gonna Break]
It's all gonna break
Well, it's all gonna break
When I was a kid, you fucked me in the ass
But I took my pen to paper and I passed
You know I love the shit because the shit tastes so good
I got pastures waiting in the woods
Because it's all gonna break
Well, it's all gonna break
Treat me like a sign, sounds like so well
I know times like these are the hell
And when you do the tricks, the tricks look so good
I got buried rumors waiting in the woods
And they try to climb awake and call me over
Skies they rape and skies are sober
Minds they fake and minds rolled over
It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good to love
I know that you're dying, I know that it's true
I know there's seven thousand things you rather be and rather do
And I know that you fuck what you love and you love what you fuck
I'll keep them out girl, I'll keep it true
I'll do anything inside the skin of you
Because I know that the sound of your heart is a god I can trust
Like a man, not a boy, I don't love, I just fight with the violence in ourselves
It's all gonna break!
It's all gonna break!
And you all want the lovely music to save your lives
And you all want the lovely music to save your lives
Keep it coming, there is no lie to save your life
Keep it coming, this is the lie to save your life
Why are you always fucking ghosts?
Why are you always fucking ghosts?
Why, why, why are you always fucking ghosts?
It's been such a long
Life that we trust
Your heart is a whore
And love is just lust
You want what you can't
And you can't cause of fear
We've got to get
Out of here
Why are you always—
Why are you always—
Why, why, why?
Why?!

Mouth's like a cigarette
Hooked on a fever
So, devils, settle down
Mind is a broken cliff
Hearts full of semen
So throw yourself down
Mouths on a distant chest
Minus the breathing
So throw yourself down

The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns, big guns, big guns

Cloned in the water
The children are freezing
So throw yourself down
Canceled the other plans
Leaving the leaving
So throw yourself down
God is a good defense
Blood in the bleeding
So throw yourself down
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns, big guns, big guns
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns, big guns, big guns


Your mouth's like a cigarette
Your eyes are the fever
So throw yourself down
The mouth is a messenger
Your mind is a healer
So throw yourself down

The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns, big guns
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns, the big guns
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns, the big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out
The big guns are coming out

[Trackname: All My Friends]

All my friends in magazines
Got addicted to the word "leave"
And they all wrote songs that they believe
Little lies and massive dreams

And they all request that you slow down
And they all request that you slow down
You've got to turn it around
And make a save

There's a whore inside their bed
The duvets wish that they were still wet
And all the songs they wrote instead
Your ex-lover is not dead

And they all request that you slow down
And they all request that you slow down
You've got to turn it around
And make a save

All my friends in magazines
Got addicted to the word "leave"
And all the songs that you believe
Once they stop you can't repeat
Once you stop you can't repeat
