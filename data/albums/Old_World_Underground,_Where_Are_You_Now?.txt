[Trackname: IOU]
Old world underground, where are you now?
Subtract my age from the mileage on my speeding heart, credit cards
Accelerate, accumulate
Looked for you downtown
Wound up in a movie with no story
Now it’s late and you are nowhere to be found
Hesitation’s always mine
Hesitate outside the times
With all I don’t say
With all I don’t do
I’m sending you invitations to hesitate too
Every ten year-old enemy soldier
Thinks falling bombs are shooting stars sometimes
But she doesn’t make wishes on them
When she wishes, she wishes for less ways to wish for
More ways to work toward it
Ten year-old enemy soldier
Our falling bombs are her shooting stars
Hesitation’s always mine
Hesitate outside the times
Oh, call me or drop me a line
Say you’ve been with me
Say you’ve been with me
Say you’ve been with me this whole time
Old world underground, I never knew you
But I’ve seen your face everywhere
There was a farm before we tore the small town down
Multiply, 

[Trackname: Hustle Rose]

Behold the fishnet slut tonight
Hustle Rose goes from limb to limb
Fingertip to painted lip, she sways her way up to him
Says, "Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
You're gonna wanna wear it out."

If you're looking for something lifelike
Hit a sardine nightclub
If every surface you touch is cold, never go home
He says, "I can't feel a thing, my dreams are so tight
Why wouldn't I stand in line tonight?"

Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
You're gonna wanna wear it out
You're gonna wanna wear it out
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
Now that your wallet is all lit up
You're gonna wanna wear it out
You're gonna wanna wear it out

You could throw me a bone
If I get too close, you wake me up
Remind me softly to go
If I forget, won't you wake me up?
Remind me not to feel a thing
Keep the dream tight
I can't feel a thing
My dreams are so tight
Can't feel anything
My dreams are so tight
Why wouldn't I stand in line tonight

[Trackname: Succexy]

Lonesome for no one when
The room was empty
And war as we knew it was obsolete
Nothing could beat complete denial

All we do is talk, sit, switch screens
As the homeland plans enemies
All we do is talk, static split-screens
As the homeland plans enemies

Invasion's so succexy, so succexy
Invasion's so succexy, so succexy

Let's drink to the military
The glass is empty
Faces to fill and cars to feed
Nothing could beat complete denial

All we do is talk, sit, switch screens
As the homeland plans enemies
All we do is talk, static split-screens
As the homeland plans enemies
Invasion's so succexy, so succexy
(So succexy, so succexy)
Invasion's so succexy, so succexy
(So succexy, so succexy)
Invasion's so succexy, so succexy
(So succexy, so succexy)
Invasion's so succexy, so succexy
(So succexy)

Passive attraction, programmed reaction
Passive attraction, programmed reaction
Action, distraction, more information
Flesh saturation, lips on a napkin
Ass, ass, ass
Where does the time go?
We're waking up so slowly
Days are horizontal lately
Out of body, watched from above
Out of body, watched from above
Passive attraction, programmed reaction
More information, cash masturbation
Follow the pattern - the hemlines, the headlines
Action, distraction, faster than fashion
Faster than fashion, faster than fashion
Lonesome for no one when
The room was empty
And war as we knew it was obsolete
Nothing could beat 

[Trackname: Combat Baby]

We used to leave the blue lights on and there was a beat
Ever since you have been gone, it's all caffeine-free
Faux punk fatigues
Said it all before
They try to kick it, their feet fall asleep
Get no harm done, no
None of them want to fight me

Combat baby
Come back, baby
Fight off the lethargy
Don't go quietly
Combat baby
You said you would never give up easy
Combat baby, come back

Get back in town
I wanna paint it black
I wanna get around
Easy living crowd, so flat
Said it all before
They try to kick it, their feet fall asleep
I want to be wrong
But no one here wants to fight me like you do
Combat baby
Come back, baby
Fight off the lethargy
Don't go quietly
Combat baby
Said you would never give up easy
Combat baby, come back


I try to be so nice
Compromise
Who gets it good?
Every mighty, mild seventies child
Every mighty, mild seventies child
Beats me
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)

Combat baby
Come back, baby
Combat baby, come back
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, baby
Combat baby, come back
How I miss your ranting
Do you miss my all time lows

[Trackname: Calculation Theme]
I'm sick, you're tired
Let's dance
Break to love, make lust
I know it isn't
I'm sick, you're tired
Let's dance, dance, dance
Cold as numbers but let's dance
As though it were easy for you to lead me
I could be passive, gracefully
Half the horizon's gone
Skyline of numbers
Half the horizon's gone
Working the numbers
'Til I'm sick
Sleep don't pacify us until daybreak sky lights up the grid we live in
Dizzy when we talk so fast
Fields of numbers streaming past
I wish we were farmers
I wish we knew how to grow sweet potatoes and milk cows
I wish we were lovers
But it's for the best
Tonight, your ghost will ask my ghost
"Where is the love?"
Tonight, your ghost will ask my ghost
"Who here is in line for a raise?"
Tonight, your ghost will ask my ghost
"Where is the love?"
Tonight, your ghost will ask my ghost
"Who put these bodies between us?"

[Trackname: Wet Blanket]
Falling for the creep, the body leech, here he comes
Vicious hypnosis, clenched fist saying it's wrong
To want more than a folk song
Underneath the shaker knit, he's a brick wall
She keep falling for the trick, vegetarian sing-along
Give a little kick with your fine thigh-high
Do-do-do, we're on to you
Tearing her down, talking her down under your breath
Making a mess
See, she is happy you wanna break it
Do-do-do, we're on to you
Tearing her down, talking her down under your breath
Making a mess
See, she is happy you wanna break it
Do-do-do, we're on to you
Your phony roots, borrowed guitar
Telling her what to think we are
You're the number one wet blanket
Hardly a day goes by you don't try to break down
No, I don't buy it
You're still around, I wonder why
She just keep…
Falling for the creep, the body leech, here he comes
Vicious hypnosis, clenched fist saying it's wrong
To want more than a folk song
Underneath the shaker knit, he's a brick wall
She keep falling for the creep
The body leech coming on
Vicious hypnosis, clenched fist saying
It's wrong to want more than a folk song
I'm wrong to want more than a folk song
I'm wrong to want more than a folk song
Underneath the shaker knit, he's a brick wall
She keep falling for the trick, vegetarian sing-along

[Trackname: On a Slow Night]

True beautiful one
What have you gone and done?
I can see all your moves are new
Tell me, what did that salesman do to you?
That catalogue replaced
The fine mind behind your face
No human trio can compete
When that three-way mirror meets your eye

On a slow night
On a slow night

How you would walk the fashion mile
Hand-me-down and call it style
Well, your boots were scratchy black
And your hat was just a hat
Yeah, though lips on you were plain
The better to a kiss sustain

On a slow night
On a slow night
Doo d-doo d-doo-oo
Doo d-doo d-doo-oo
Doo d-doo d-doo-oo
Doo d-doo d-doo

[Trackname: The List]

All dressed down to catch a whiff of the buzz
Smells like the death of the last great cause
But you and I, we've been through that
That is not our fate
Give my face to the back of your head
Loyal in your shadow
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Broken accidental stars

Do lawyers have lawyers?
Do landlords have landlords?
We're wondering
One more cheap suit in the loop
More chlorine in the pool
The blonde doll smiling behind us
Says, "One day, you'll be just like us."

All dressed up to catch a glimpse of the list
We've seen some success, it looks like a camero
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Broken accidental stars

Do lawyers have lawyers?
Do landlords have landlords?
We're wondering
One more cheap suit in the loop
More chlorine in the pool
The blonde doll smiling behind us
Says, "One day, you'll be just like us."
Calling from the next hotel – can you put me on the list?
Who we are now, we will always be – the best haircuts are taken

[Trackname: Dead Disco]

Skip town, slow down
Push it to the east coast
Step down, turn around
Push it to the west
Need less, use less
We're asking for too much, I guess
'Cause all we get is...

Dead disco
Dead funk
Dead rock and roll
Remodel
Everything has been done
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Dead disco

Everything has been done
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Tits out, pants down
Overnight to London
Touch down, look around
Everyone's the same
Worldwide, airtight
No one's got a face left to blame
And all we get is...
Dead disco
Dead funk
Dead rock and roll
Remodel
Everything has been done
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Trackname: Love Is A Place]

There's spring in the air
They're sweeping the streets
The wind is a breeze
The sun becomes her, he agrees

What's holding up her face?
Nothing but blue skies
Passageways to windows
That don't close

Where do you live?
Love is a place
Where are you from?
She says, "Ask yourself, ask anyone"

What's holding up her face?
Nothing but blue skies
Passageways, the mind's eye
Contemplates
