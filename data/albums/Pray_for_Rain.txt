[Trackname: The Tower]

Over matter, mind come true
All my temples turn to tombs
Darkest towers, I filled the rooms
Tiled in designs I drew

So many faces I can’t see
They’re echoing things I can’t believe

The deep ecstatic
Of darkest magic
It’s breathless tragic
A mask for madness

Envious eyes all empty pools
When the stars become your jewels

So many faces I can’t see
They’re echoing things I can’t believe
I hear the tower’s tone
Don’t tell me that I’m alone
The deep ecstatic of darkest magic
It’s breathless tragic
A mask for madness
The deep ecstatic of darkest magic
It’s breathless tragic
A mask for madness
I hear the tower’s tone
Don’t tell me I’m alone
I hear the tower’s tone
Don’t tell me I’m alone

Don’t tell me I’m alone
Alone, oh no

[Trackname: Pray for Rain]

Are you rough and ready tumble?
Are you careless like a child?
When you lost her did you smile?
Do you stumble are you wild?
Are you fading in the shadows?
Is it always on your mind?
When they ask, do you decline?
Are you ruthless? Are you kind?

Or are you cut in two?
Cut all the way through
Are you cut in two?
Cut all the way through

Are you hot and heavy jungle?
Visions lifted in the lace
Was it just a little taste?
Did you say it to his face?
Now you’re dancing in the shadows
And they’re calling out your name
Is it pleasure? Is it pain?
Did you pray for rain?
Or are you cut in two? (Cut in two)
Cut all the way through (Cut all the way through)
Are you cut in two? (Cut in two)
Cut all the way through (Cut all the way through)
Or are you cut in two? (Cut in two)
Cut all the way through (Cut all the way through)
Are you cut in two? (Cut in two)
Cut all the way through (Cut all the way through)

Cut all the way through (Cut all the way through)
Are you cut, cut, cut, cut?
Cut all the way through (Cut all the way through)
Are you cut, cut, cut, cut?
Uh-huh!
Cut all the way through (Cut all the way through)
Cut all the way through (Cut all the way through)
Cut all the way through (Cut all the way through)
Uh-huh!
Cut all the way through (Cut all the way through)
Cut all the way through (Cut all the way through)
Uh-huh!
Cut all the way through (Cut all the way through)
Cut all the way through (Cut all the way through)
Cut all the way through (Cut all the way through)
Uh-huh!
Cut all the way 

[Trackname: Palest Pearl]

Palest pearl
Pearl of greatest price
Poured first form
It’s all you wanted

But you’re caught up in the rush
Of lust
Do you really want that much
Trust
The maze, your mind

It’s curling opaline
In the finest curve
There’s light in all design

But you’re caught up in the rush
Of lust
Do you really want that much
Trust
Does it make you want to run
The touch?
Or would you watch it turn to dust
For lust?
Palest pearl
Pearl of greatest price
Palest pearl
There’s light in all design

[Trackname: Clover]

Your onyx bracelet
Your prisimed iris

Clover throated all your words
Petaled lips, you swore them first

Charm brings you amulets
Like Venus born into violet light

Clover throated all your words
Petaled lips, you swore them first

How pale your skin
So move in slow motion
Waves double back and rumble in
They tumble
Oooohh

Clover throated all your words
Petaled lips, you swore them first
Your greenest eyes all emerald glow
In your garden orchids grow
Clover throated all your words
Petaled lips, you swore them first
Your greenest eyes all emerald glow
And in your garden orchids grow

They grow
They grow
They grow
They grow
They grow

[Trackname: Darling, Save Us]

Pitch the line you’ve drawn it over
Switch to mind your four leaf clover
Find the rhyme in hidden orders
And time will braid the bands
Never mind our best intending
First the needle, then the mending
Just pretend it’s never ending
And time will braid the bands

Darling, save us, we’re in danger
All in a, all in a day, take it away
All in a day, take it away

When the line of light’s intentions
Never spoken, never mentioned
Never mind, tonight remember
Time will braid the bands

Darling, save us, we’re in danger
All in a, all in a day, take it away
All in a day, take it away
All in a day, take it away
All in day, all in all in a
All in all in a…

[Trackname: Singer]

My mirror, remember
The folds in our feathers
The line and the measure
Of the wings of, of the sender

And all of this has, passed between us
To crack it open and release us

Youth was black and blue, but I’m a singer
And time is braided bands
But I would give you rings for every finger
And ribbons for your hair

And I do surrender
My darkest endeavors
The fire in the embers
My mirror, remembers

And all of this has, passed between us
To crack it open and release us
Youth was black and blue, but I’m a singer
And time is braided bands
But I would give you rings for every finger, and ribbons for your hair
Youth was black and blue, but I’m a singer
And time is braided bands
But I would give you rings for every finger, and ribbons for your hair
Truth when black and blue, it tends to linger, like silver in your hair
But I would give you rings for every finger, and time is braided bands
You catch it when you can, like silver in your hair

[Trackname: She Shakes]

An angel queen
With downy wings
While out alone and traveling
Came wandering
The bubble king
From under rivers rippling

Through silver slivers, of colors in his cape
Her heart begins to shake

She shakes
She shakes
She shakes

Oh bubble king, you’re everything
The sparking zenith of my ring
When you speak to me, in dark heart beats
The sound it leaves me trembling

I shiver lover, a quiver and a quake
And my heart begins to shake
She shakes
She shakes
She shakes

For wildest wishes for all her prayers and visions
Of reckless hearts in rhythm

She shakes
She shakes
She shakes…

[Trackname: Maximilian's Ring]

Impressions of a love
To fool the careless of the eye
For you to conjure up
So simple in your mind

Wicked and wild, haven’t you seen yourself
Loneliest isle, lost in the greenest swells

Confess it to yourself, the light the loyal oval shines
For you and no one else, a fool a million miles

Wicked and wild, haven’t you seen yourself
Lonliest isle, lost in the greenest swells
Wicked and wild, haven’t you seen yourself
Lonliest isle, lost in the greenest swells
Lonliest isle, lost in the greenest swells
Fooled with a smile, haven’t you had enough?

Remember Maximilian? he used to sing
Remember Maximilian? they stole his ring
So we say thanks a million for everything
And we’ll go on together without a ring
And we say thank you thank you thank you thank you
And we say thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you

[Trackname: I Trace Your Symbol]

I keep it soft and bright
I keep it tied up tight
It’s magic when it’s right
It’s magic
I chased the sound down there
Can’t find it anywhere
I trace you on my right
I trace your symbol

La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la

Under the arbor
Where I read your verses
Of precious treasure
And hidden purses
I chased your sound down there
Can’t find you anywhere
I trace you on my right
I trace your symbol
We met in the middle
To solve the riddle
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la

When winter whispers
To the moon
She lights a candle
In every room
When winter whispers
Whispers your name
You’ll find a window
You’ll find a flame

So keep it tied up tight
So keep it soft and bright
I trace you on my right
It’s a matter of heart, not a matter of, not a matter of mind
Tonight
So keep it soft and bright
I trace you on my right
It’s a matter of heart, not a matter of, not a matter of mind
Tonight
So keep it tied up tight
I trace you on my right
It’s a matter of heart, not a matter of, not a matter of mind
Tonight
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la

[Trackname: In the Night, in the Peaceful Night]

No rest, oh no
For the weary fold
What’s left unknown
In the night, in the peaceful night

Lonely believer, you can’t shake the feeling
When all that you need is, to heal by revealing
The heat in your fever, it’s hot in the evening
To test the night

Regrets, oh no
Better let it go
What’s next, unknown
In the night in the peaceful night

Lonely believer, no use in concealing
When all that you need is, to heal by revealing
The heat in the fever, so hot in the evening
To test the night
You test the night
And you learn to shine in the peaceful night
Yeah, in the night, in the peaceful night
