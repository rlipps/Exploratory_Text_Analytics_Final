[Trackname: Offspring Are Blank]


There was a single one
Then there were ten
With time, made a hundred
And a hundred million
You came and spoke to me
I saw your face
Your words were like raindrops
From a storm in a vase
Each generation different

He was made to love her
She was made to love him
And their offspring love them

And in the marriage of
Eagle and snake
The parents are fertile
But the offspring is blank
The fire rages and
All through the night
The flame is contagious
But the heat feels all right
Can't recognize our poverty

He was made to love her
She was made to love him
And their offspring love them

There is a darkness I
Feel comin' down
And shadows that lengthen
From the sky to the ground
And a silence that can swallow sound

He was made to love her
She was made to love him
And their offspring love them
He was made to love her
She was made to love him
And their offspring love both of 

[Trackname: About to Die]
If the search has been long and futile and brutal
And if you squint trying to recollect the bosom of your hoodlum love (hey baby)
You reach out and into the absence and gasping
The vastness grabs you like an alien embrace
Your face to its face
No end and neither beginning you're spinning
You're breathless, orbiting a dark and hateful star
An evil world
Where would I ever be without you?
How could I hope to seize the tablet of values and redact it?
Foolish I know but I'm about to die
About to die
Your life must surely be ending and trembling
You realize you never lived a day at all (Wait)
And it's all your fault (Wow)
It all seems unspeakably vile and while
You wretch the memory of all you understood
The vandal laughs into his hood
Where would I ever be without you?
How could I hope to seize the tablet of values and redact 'em?
Foolish I know but I'm about to die
About to die
Look there the goblins dressed up like a wound
Mutants all vagrant and hateful
Look there the mirror a zombie stands staring
Vacant and glaring pronouncing your name
As you're saying
About to die
Where would I ever be without you? (No fucking clue)
How could I hope to seize the tablet of values and redact it?
Foolish I know but I'm about to die
About to die
About to die
You're already dead
But you're about to die
(Damn, you got it)
(All right, awesome

[Trackname: Gun Has No Trigger]

If you had looked, you might have just seen them
Strut in the background
You'd see the oceans swirl
And the mountains shook
You'd see a million colors
If you really looked

Now, quick the night draws near
Her curtain spreads quicker
The safety's off
But the gun has no trigger

If you had looked, you'd be no one's coward
Distance, justice, power
You'd glimpse the password
You wouldn't need the book
You'd own both slave and master
If you just had looked

But now the banks all closed
And nothing gets bigger
The crowd will yell
But the gun has no trigger
If you had looked, you might reconsider
Or just maybe you already have
They watch you sleeping
You watch their garbage cook
You'd weep a bowl of tears
If you had looked

But now the gate comes down
The pangs are growing dimmer
You hold a gun to your head
But the gun has no 

[Trackname: Swing Lo Magellan]
Last night all my attention
Squinting westward 'ere the sunset with a map and a compass
When a man reached up, said something
"There, against the sky, a point of light
Too invisible to give itself to the naked eye"
On the shore, people yellin'
In their eyes a great reflection
In the grid aware their position
Unconcerned with intuition
There can never be no sympathy
From that wilderness so let it be arrested

Swing lo, oh, Magellan
Nine-by-six or eight-by-seven
Post a sentinel at the border of what you attempt, what you ignore
I saw my frame in a pool of light
Oh, drowned in doubt and shame, and I knew that I had lost my 

[Trackname: Just From Chevron]
Where she collapses into the shore
Pump her like product and, ask her for more
There a man lay dying in ice
Gasket had busted and
Pinned him like a vice
As the sun sank into repose
A friend knelt and
Listened to his dying words as he froze:
"Tell my love don't mourn too intense
I'm going down to her great good expense
Now all the air is quiet and still
Wish I was back home on that knell in the hill
Don't think I won't try
When I close my eyes
Wherever the people will drive
That's where I will survive
All of my friends, my enemies too
Live in the shadows of the dirtiest fuel
Burns the land and its people to ruin
While wind's always whistlin' an infinite tune
Don't think I won't try
When I close my eyes
Wherever the people will drive
I swear I will be live
Don't think I won't try
When I close my eyes
Wherever the people will drive
I swear I will be live
I swear I will be live
I swear I will be live
I swear I will be live
I swear I will be live"
"Now so long," he whispered so faint
Closing his eyelids with his face turning grey
When the workers cleaned up the spill
Sent the man home to his knell in the hill

[Trackname: Dance For You]
I ran across cyanide planes
Mind like a prison cell
But feet untethered and sane
I wandered out hopeless and sad
No thought of where I'd go
Or how I'd ever get back
There is an answer
I haven't found it
But I will keep dancing 'till I do (ooh)
I boogied down gargoyle streets
Searching in every face
For something I could believe
I knelt beneath one hundred saints
I wanna feel the breath
Of a force I cannot explain
There is an answer
I haven't found it
But I will keep dancing till I do (ooh)
Dance for you

There is an answer
I haven't found it
But I will keep dancing till I do (ooh)
Dance for you
Dance for you
Dance for 

[Trackname: Maybe That Was It]
If you saw the surface rip and bloom with rot
Some part doing what some other part will not
Maybe that was it
If you saw a shadow rise beyond the hiss
Iridescent and pretend anonymous
Maybe that was it
If you saw a weapon that so smooth transfixed
Cylinders of language pounded into bricks
Maybe that was it
If you saw an animal in hard retreat
Hundred parasites all burrowed in so deep
Maybe that was it

[Trackname: Impregnable Question]

If there is ever the impregnable question
Of why what did or didn't pass
It would help to seek
Comfort in destiny
But I really don't --
We don't see eye to eye
But I need you
And you're always on my mind

Whether there is or isn't any position
You care if I take or I don't
I will always hope
What we shared so long
To be the only love
And though we don't see eye to eye
I need you
And you're always on my mind

Through time and through many a situation
We both look forward side-by-side
We have shared it all
We have both stood tall
What is mine is yours, in happiness and in strife
You're my love
And I want you in my 

[Trackname: See What She Seeing]
Mornings I wake up hung over
Lower than mornings before
I don't know, memory's torture
Or maybe what I deserve
Lonely and forgotten in the frozen world
Scorned in my desire
Ignored by all the girls
I need someone to comfort me
Whose hair is whipping (wild and free)
Whose mouth is smiling (wide open)
Whose eyes are shining looking at me and
I can see what she seeing
Everywhere I go I see her
Everywhere I look she disappears
Every time I think I've found her
Just what I've found is unclear
So onward through the murk and the uncertainty
Sifting through the days, patient and carefully
Always to get to where she is
Her hair is whipping (wild and free)
Her mouth is smiling (wide open)
Her eyes are shining looking at me and
I can see what she seeing
Yeah yeah
I can see what she seeing
Yeah yeah
I can see what she seeing
"But you can't see me"
Tell me the way to the orchid
Tell me the way and I'll be there
Give me a day to go forward
Give me your hand and we'll go there
Forward through the clover and the bergamot
Shoreward to the gulls and to the guillemots
Who're rising alone among the winds
Her hair is whipping (wild and free)
Whose mouth is smiling (wide open)
Her eyes are shining looking at me and
I can see what she seeing
Yeah yeah
I can see what she seeing
Yeah yeah
I can see what she seeing
Yeah yeah
I can see what she seeing
Yeah yeah
I can see what she seeing

[Trackname: The Socialites]

I think she’s the prettiest lady I’ve ever seen
Her hair — it has meaning and volume and such a sheen
Sometimes I think maybe I could go and talk to her
Her eyes — they look lonely, far away and inert

Oh baby, the socialites who act so nice
Won't ever begin to let you in
They’ll act surprised, apologize
Won't ever let on
The face you wear is their own

I’m gonna try combing my hair in a thousand ways
Maybe he will notice and maybe look my way

Oh baby, the other guys who act so nice
Won't ever begin to let you in
Stars in their eyes, they’ll apologize
Won't ever let on
They need someone real

But they don’t know where I’m going
It’s not impossible to show
But to show is to open up
The socialites who act so nice
Won't ever begin to let you in
They’ll act surprised, they'll apologize
Won't ever let on
The face you wear is their own

I'm glad they're the ones on the other side of the glass
Who knows what my spirit is worth in cold, hard cash
Oh 

[Trackname: Unto Caesar]
Accident or intention
It's already history
Random or intelligent
The mute march into victory
Innocent or innocent enough to say
"I did what I did, I did what I did only"
Render unto Caesar
Scrawled and all illegible
You kept yourself hidden well
Sprawling and inflexible
The world asked you for nothing else
So and forward, lifelong in the gentle breeze
Moral as a leaf, to fall and to decease, you
Render unto Caesar
("When should we bust into harmony?")
Where the grayscale conjurers (flip it)
Where the lifelike perjurers (write it)
Where the vested spectators (watch it)
Where the weapon chancellor (gun it)
Where the twilight mandolin (play it)
Where the high custodian (mop it)
Where the panic violent (panic)
Where the crabby handmaiden is (scrub it)
Down the line, down the mercenary barbary
Down the line, dead the martyrs' morbid poetry
("What are we singing?")
("Uh, that doesn't make any sense what you just said. Hey, can you—")
Down the rampart, the vandals given to defeat
And down the landscape
The lineman plastered for a, for a, for a week
Render unto Caesar
Render unto Caesar

[Trackname: Irresponsible Tune]
With our song we are outlaws
With our songs, we're alone
But without songs we're lost
And life is pointless, harsh, and long
In my heart, there is music
In my mind is a song
But in my eyes a world crooked, fucked up, and wrong
Sing all day
Record and play
Drums and bass
And a guitar
Will there be peace in the world?
Or will violence always own the truth?
There's a bird singing at my window
And it's singing an irresponsible tune
An irresponsible tune
An irresponsible
