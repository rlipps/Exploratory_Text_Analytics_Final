[Trackname: Abducted]

I knew right then that I'd been abducted
I knew right then that he would be taking my heart
I knew right then no one was above him
I knew right then that he would be breaking my heart

He tore me apart because I really loved him
He took my heart away and left me to bleed out, bleed out
He broke my heart because I really loved him
He took it all away and left me to bleed out, bleed out

I knew right then that she'd been abducted
I knew right then that I would be taking her heart
I knew right then that I'd never love her
No reasons to hope, no dream was bliss from the start

He tore me apart because I really loved him
He took my heart away and left me to bleed out, bleed out
He broke my heart because I really loved him
He took it all away and left me to bleed out, bleed out
He tore me apart because I really loved him
He took my heart away and left me to bleed out, bleed out
He broke my heart because I really loved him
He took it all away and left me to bleed out, bleed 

[Trackname: Go Outside]

"But to me, death is not… death is not a fearful thing, it's living that's treacherous."
"Don’t be afraid to die. If these people land out here, they'll, they’ll torture some of our children here. They’ll torture our people. They’ll torture our seniors. We cannot have this."

I, I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and stop to see your day
You, you really want to hole up
You really want to stay inside and sleep the light away
I, I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and make it light all day
You, you really want to hole up
You really want to stay inside and not care where you lay

But I know what's good
Exactly 'cause I have been there before
Yeah, I know what's good
Exactly those things night cannot behold

I, I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and stop to see your day
You, you really want to hole up
You really want to stay inside and sleep the light away
I, I think it's good to go out
'Cause if you don't you'll never make a memory that will stay
I, I think that we should break up
I think I want to live my life and you're just in my 

[Trackname: You Know What I Mean]

I, I can't take things slowly
Come, then go away, that's what they all do
Help me 'cause I'm feeling shaky
Tell me what's wrong with my brain 'cause I seem to have lost it

'Cause I am afraid of the light
Yeah, you know what I mean
And I can't sleep alone at night
Yeah, you know what I mean

Lonely, that's not quite my problem
I have all that I need, haven't quite lost it
I tried so hard to be happy
'Cause something goes wrong once again

Please, please come and save me
Tell me what's wrong with my brain
'Cause I seem to have lost it

'Cause I am afraid of the light
Yeah, you know what I mean
And I can't sleep alone at night
Yeah, you know what I mean
'Cause I am afraid of the light
Yeah, you know what I mean
'Cause I can't sleep alone at night
Yeah, you know what I 

[Trackname: Most Wanted]

Up late at night all alone
Can't you see I'm trying?
Trying so hard to hold on
To the things I know

But in the evening I will have to go
What I most want is bad for me I know

Out in the dark, shaking hands
In the street, I'm drifting
Drifting away from my family
Towards my foes

My mother told me "you'll reap what you sow"
"What you want most is bad for you, you know"

Back in my home late at night
All alone, I'm flying
Flying above all my troubles
My mind's a gull
When I am happy my heart starts to slow
What I most want is bad for me I know

Late in the morning I wake
All alone, I'm crying
Crying for all of the people
Who love me so

But when we get sad we know where to go
What we most want is bad for us we know

"Fornication, drug use and adultery

[Trackname: Walk At Night]
When I walk at night I can't help but I know its right
When I walk alone I'm hoping for things unknown
When I'm on my own I try to get as far from home
When I wanna be, there's no bright light surrounding me
When I walk at night I can't help but I know its right
When I walk alone I'm hoping for things unknown
When I clear your side, I'm searching for some surprise
When I'm by your side I can't forget all our ties
When I'm on my own I try to get as far from home
When I wanna be, there's no bright light surrounding me
You keep on tryin to make make believe
That no one knows of your lies and your deceit
There's no use in me tryin to be the things
I wanted and that's right for me
There's no point playing hard to get
I figured I'll just sit on your swing
It's easy singing everyday until I walk at night

[Trackname: Never Heal Myself]
Tell me all the things that you thought weren't right about me
And my life
Tell me there's a way that I can shake this cloud and stand near
To your light
I never wanted anyone to say that I had hidden myself
In disguise
Please don't leave me lonely tell me all the ways to make myself right
In your eyes
But I can never heal myself enough for
Never heal myself enough for you
Tell me all the things that you thought weren't right about me
And my life
Tell me there's a way that I can shake this frown and see clear
Through your sight
I never wanted anyone to say that I have led myself wrong
By your side
Please don't leave me lonely tell me all the ways to make myself right
In your eyes
But I can never heal myself enough for
Never heal myself enough for, no
Never heal myself enough for you
I tried to heal myself
And turn around to someone else
But I can never be myself, so fuck 

[Trackname: Oh My God]

Oh my God
I'm stuck inside the same position
I'm so tired of sitting around here with my boring life
Wishing I could find another name to go by
Late at night I'm dreaming about a time
Where I could change my side

Please don't tell me you know the rules to go by
I could run away and leave you anytime
Please don't tell me you know the plans for my life
I could run away and leave you here to stay inside dreaming

I'm so tired of all these honest decisions
Oh my God, I'm ready to walk right out that door
I never wanted a single thing for my life
All I wanted was to know that I have never wasted my time

Please don't tell me you know the rules to go by
I could run away and leave you anytime
Please don't tell me you know the plans for my life
I could run away and leave you here to stay inside dreaming
Oh my God
I'm stuck in the same ancient tradition
I'm so tired of thinking about the things that I have been missing
I never wanted a single thing for my life
All I wanted was to know that I have never wasted my time

Please don't tell me you know the rules to go by
I could run away and leave you anytime
Please don't tell me you know the plans for my life
I could run away and leave you here to stay inside dreaming

[Trackname: Never Saw The Point]

I never saw the point in trying
'Cause I would only let you down
And I just couldn't take you down there with me
I just can't stand to see you drown
I never saw the point in crying
'Cause I can't be the way you want
And I don't want lay around here waiting
Waiting for you to change your mind

I
Just keep on telling myself
That I
I don't need anyone else
Yeah, I'd
Be just fine on my own
That I
Can make it out
I should
I know

I never saw the point in trying
'Cause I would only let you down
And I just couldn't take you down there with me
I just can't stand to see you drown
I never saw the point in crying
'Cause I can't be the way you want
And I don't want lay around here waiting
Waiting for you to change your mind
I
I don't know what else I can do
Now I'm
Done trying 'cause you
Yeah, I
Could never stop loving you
But there's
Nothing else for me to do

I never saw the point in trying
'Cause I would only let you down
And I just couldn't take you down there with me
I just can't stand to see you drown
I never saw the point in crying
'Cause I can't be the way you want
And I don't want lay around here waiting
Waiting for you to change your mind

What I wouldn't give for the chance to see you smile
I did what I could to be yours just for a while
What I wouldn't give for the chance to see you smile
'Cause I would

[Trackname: Bad Things]

Bad things happen to the people you love
And you'll find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly, I've never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me

I'm gonna run-run away, run run away
Run away, run away and never come back
Run-run away, run-run away, run away
Show 'em that your color is black

Bad things happen to the people you love
And you'll find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly, I've never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me

It would take some time just to see me shine
For the whole world to see me here with all of my light
But honestly, I've given up on all those fights
So that one day I'll have you all wrapped up in my light

I'm gonna run-run away, run run away
Run away, run away and never come back
Run-run away, run-run away, run away
Show 'em that your color is black
I'm gonna run-run away, run-run away
Run away and never come back
Run-run away, run-run away, run away
Show 'em that your color is black
(And I don't think we should sit here) And take any more time for our children to be endangered, for if they come after our children and we give them our children, then our children will suffer forever…
You had to be honest and you stayed. If you'd have wanted to run, you'd have had to run with them because anybody could've run today, they would have wanted to. I know you're not a runner and your life is precious to me. It's as precious as John's. And I don't… what I do, I do with weight and justice and judgment…

Bad things happen to the people you love
And you'll find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly, I've never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you'll find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly, I've never had much sympathy
'Cause the next time you're praying, you'll be praying for 

[Trackname: Bumper]

He had been untrue
I had learned of all his lies
I took a look in her eyes
And she caught me by surprise
I threw his shit on the floor
She rushed me out of the door
He tried to explain
I didn't do anything
Knew that he was bad
Never knew just what he had
I still don't have a line
But I'll find one soon in time
Started crying my eyes out
I drive my car and boost out
I wish we never met
I never had a regret
I've had it up to here
I can't take this any more
If she's this crazy now
There's no telling what's in store

Maybe I should start a life with someone new
And give up all my hopes for
I went down the drive
And he caught me by surprise
I took a look in her eyes
Said "I need you in my life"
I'm in love with him
I'm in love with her

We gotta give it a chance
La, la, la, la
But I don't know
La, la, la, la

[Trackname: Rave On]

On a boat, on my sailing ship
On my own, far away from it
Give me death, but don't give me this
I'll pass if that's ok

To rave on, rave on
So rave on, rave on

In a class where you got an A
Feel your lover's lips on your favorite day
In your mother's arms when you blast away
I'll pass if that's ok
On a stage where you love to play
On your knees, look for words to say
Thank God every single day
I'll pass if that's ok

To rave on, rave on
So rave on, rave on

On a boat, on my sailing ship
On my own, far away from it
Give me death, but don't give me this
I'll pass if that's ok
To rave on, rave on
So rave on, rave on
To rave on, rave on
So rave on, rave on

Yo I prayed for these better days
Since freedom came
I'm serving bars you hoping I beat the case
Ain't that a change
The Panda changed
Slowed down the pace
To learn and to bring some change
I'm sold to this
I'ts J's and codes how niggas would die for this
Excuse the dis
Only advantage here
They started early
Barely touching a younger me
Barely notice they under me
Dreams of bumble jewellery pushing me
Foolery tom boy's the with twisting Toungue
Until it pays
So pass the Courvoisier
Like Mama said I'm destined for greater things
For greater things
Rolling with bad man
Downlow dunno
And you ain't making money like me
You downlow dunno
Money so handsom

Its a must that we celebrate
Been through the most
Still feel like one day I'll choke
They rugby blokes
They hate when I'm knocking on
With word and song
Been holding on
It looked like I'm falling off
But kingdom come
Like coke and rum got hits but they never saw
They never saw
Just how he potent
God know I'm such a Showman
Dome in constructing Rome and
Fanning the little flame in my hood
For dudes that understood that push passion u vona
Blings and your Tlerngy Dons
Culture and when it ruptures
I pray that your pocket buldges
I'm building bridges to Fortune and Comfort
Man Im just hoping they hear us but still we living
Heat but no Scotty Pippin
Limpin but still we pushing
We'll nail it no pimple poppin
They'll keep it but then we'll rob it
Dreams of my people mobbin
Dreams of my people mobbin
Dreams of my people passing Courvoisiers
