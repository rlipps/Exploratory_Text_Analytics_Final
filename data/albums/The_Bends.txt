[Trackname: Planet Telex]

You can force it but it will not come
You can taste it but it will not form
You can crush it but it's always here
You can crush it but it's always near
Chasing you home
Saying

Everything is
Broken
Everyone is
Broken

You can force it but it will stay stone
You can crush it as dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss it, you can break all the rules
All of the rules
But still

Everything is
Broken
Everyone is
Broken
Everyone is
Everyone is broken
Everyone is
Everything is broken
Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?

[Trackname: The Bends]

(Turn it up, loud!)
(Bring it up!)

Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you?
Alone on an aeroplane
Falling asleep against the windowpane
My blood'll thicken

I need to wash myself again
To hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath
And who are my real friends?
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking this low?

My baby's got the bends, oh no
We don't have any real friends
No, no, no

Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the '60s, I wish we could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
They brought in the CIA
The tanks and the whole marines
To blow me away, to blow me sky high

My baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends

Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the '60s, I wish we could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would...

I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be a part of the human race
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be a part of the human race, race, race, race

Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you?

[Trackname: High and Dry]

Two jumps in a week, I bet you
Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry


Oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing you've had has gone away

So don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me 

[Trackname: Fake Plastic Trees]

A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In a fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plants
To get rid of itself

It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out

And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time
All the 

[Trackname: Bones]

I don't want to be crippled and cracked
Shoulders, wrists, knees, and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours

When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones

Now I can't climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozac, painkillers

When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones

And I used to fly like Peter Pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands

Listen, you've got to feel it in your bones
Listen, you've got to feel it in your bones
Ah, ah, 

[Trackname: (Nice Dream)]

They love me like I was a brother
They protect me, listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine, made me happy

Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream

I call up my friend, the good angel
But she's out with her answerphone
She said that she'd love to come help, but
The sea would electrocute us all

Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream (If you think that you're strong enough)
Nice dream (If you think you belong enough)
Nice dream (If you think that you're strong enough)
Nice dream (If you think you belong enough)

Now come home
Now come home
Now come home
Now come home

Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice 

[Trackname: Just]

Can't get the stink off
He's been hanging 'round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends

One day he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow

You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

Don't get my sympathy
Hanging out the fifteenth floor
You've changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door

One day I'll get to you
And teach you how to get to purest hell
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself


You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Self

(You do it to yourself!)
(You do it to yourself!)
(Oh, you do it to yourself!)
(Oh, you do it to yourself!)

[Trackname: My Iron Lung]

Faith, you're driving me away
You do it every day
You don't mean it, but it hurts like hell
My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support, my iron lung

We're too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are losing it, can't you tell?
We scratch our eternal itch
Our twentieth century bitch
We are grateful for our iron lung
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out, we'll just hum
This, this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time, my iron lung
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

And if you're frightened, you can be frightened
You can be, it's okay
And if you're frightened, you can be frightened
You can be, it's okay


The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha 

[Trackname: Bullet Proof ... I Wish I Was]

Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
Stirring up inside of me
Every day, every hour
Wish that I... was bulletproof

Wax me, mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this
Just wish that it

Was bulletproof
Was bulletproof

So, pay me money and take a shot
Lead, fill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate

And bulletproof
And bulletproof
And bulletproof


[Trackname: Black Star]

I get home from work
And you're still standing in your dressing gown
Well, what am I to do?
I know all the things around your head
And what they do to you

What are we coming to?
What are we gonna do?

Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home

The troubled words of a troubled mind
I try to understand what is eating you
I try to stay awake, but it's fifty-eight hours
Since that I last slept with you

What are we coming to?
I just don't know anymore
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home

I get on the train and I just stand about
Now that I don't think of you
I keep falling over, I keep passing out
When I see a face like you

What am I coming to?
I'm gonna melt down

Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home

Ah, this is killing me
Ah, this is killing 

[Trackname: Sulk]

You bite through the big wall, the big wall bites back
You sit there and sulk, you sit there and bawl
You look so pretty when you're on your knees
Disinfected and eager to please

Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change

Each time it comes, it eats me alive
I try to behave, but it eats me alive
So I declare a holiday
Fall asleep, drift away

Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change

Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never 

[Trackname: Street Spirit (Fade Out)]

Rows of houses all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole

And fade out again
And fade out

This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under

And fade out again
And fade out again

Ah-na-na, ah-na-na
Ah-na-na, ah-na-na
Ah-na-na, ah-na-na
Ah-na-na, ah-na-na
Cracked eggs, dead birds, scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole

And fade out again
And fade out again

Ah-na-na, ah-na-na
Ah-na-na, ah-na-na
Ah-na-na, ah-na-na
Ah-na-na, ah-na-na
Immerse your soul in love (Ah-na-na, ah-na-na)
(Ah-na-na, ah-na-na)
Immerse your soul in love (Ah-na-na, ah-na-na)
