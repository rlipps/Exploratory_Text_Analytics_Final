[Trackname: Family Tree (Intro)]

These crosses all over my body
Remind me of who I used to be
And Christ forgive these bones I'm hiding
From no one successfully

Jesus can always reject his father
But he cannot escape his mother's blood
He'll scream and try to wash it off of his fingers
But he'll never escape what he's made up of

The fates already fucked me sideways
Swinging by my neck from the family tree
He'll laugh and say, "You know I raised you bеtter than this"
Then leavе me hanging so they all can laugh at me

[Trackname: American Teenager]

Grew up under yellow light on the street
Putting too much faith in the make-believe
And another high school football team
The neighbor's brother came home in a box
But he wanted to go, so maybe it was his fault
Another red heart taken by the American dream

And I feel it there
In the middle of the night
When the lights go out
And I'm all alone again

Say what you want, but say it like you mean it
With your fists for once, a long cold war
With your kids at the front
Just give it one more day, then you'rе done, done
I do what I want, crying in the blеachers
And I said it was fun
I don't need anything from anyone
It's just not my year
But I'm all good out here

Sunday morning
Hands over my knees in a room full of faces
I'm sorry if I sound off, but I was probably wasted (Probably wasted)
And didn't feel so good (Didn't feel so good)
Head full of whiskey but I always deliver
Jesus, if you're listening let me handle my liquor
And Jesus, if you're there
Why do I feel alone in this room with you?
And I feel it there
In the middle of the night
When the lights go out
But I'm still standing here

Say what you want, but say it like you mean it
With your fists for once, a long cold war
With your kids at the front
Just give it one more day, then you're done, done
I do what I want, crying in the bleachers
And I said it was fun
I don't need anything from anyone
It's just not my year
But I'm all good out here

Say what you want, but say it like you mean it
With your fist for once, a long cold war
With your kids at the front
Just give it one more day, then you're done
I do it for my daddy and I do it for Dale
I'm doing what I want and damn, I'm doing it well
For me, for me
For me, for 

[Trackname: A House In Nebraska]

Labored breaths and bed sores
Sing it to me all day long
When the aching sound of silence
Used to be our favorite song
You and me against the world
You were my man and I your girl
We had nothing except each other
You were my whole world
But then the day came
And you were up and gone

And I still call home that house in Nebraska
Where we found each other on a dirty mattress on the second floor
Where the world was empty
Save you and I
Where you came and I laughed, and you left, and I cried
Where you told me even if we died tonight, that I'd die yours

These dirt roads are empty
The ones we paved ourselves
Your mama calls me sometimes
To see if I'm doing well
And I lie to her
And say that I'm doing fine
When really I'd kill myself
To hold you one more time
And it hurts to miss you
But it's worse to know
That I'm the reason
You won't come home
But I still call home that house in Nebraska
Where we found each other on a dirty mattress on the second floor
(When I needed you, and I need you still)
Where the world was empty
Save you and I
Where you came and I laughed, and you left, and I cried
Where you told me even if we died tonight, that I'd die yours
(So I died there under you, every night, all night)

You know, I still wait at the edge of town
Praying straight to God that maybe you’ll come back around
I cry every day, and the bottles make it worse
'Cause you were the only one I was never scared to tell I hurt
And I found photographs of our school, on the day we met
I thought that you were so beautiful, it was love, I guess
And you might never come back home, and I may never sleep at night
But God, I just hope you're doing fine out there, I just pray that you're all right

And I feel so alone
And I feel so alone out here
I feel so alone
And I feel so alone out here
And I feel so alone without you
I'm so alone out here
I feel so alone, I feel so alone
I'm so alone out here without you, baby
(I'm alone

[Trackname: Western Nights]

He's never looked more beautiful
On his Harley in the parking lot
Breaking in to the ATMs
Sleeping naked when it gets too hot
I watched him show his love through shades of black and blue
Starting fights at the bar across the street like you do
The neighbors beat on the walls while I'm face-first in the bed
Show me how much I mean to you, while I'm lying in these sheets undressed

I'd hold the gun if you asked me to
But if you love me like you say you do
Would you ask me to

Trouble's always gonna find you baby
But so will I
Crying only because I'm happy
Hold me across every state line
I'm never gonna leave you baby
Even if you lose what's left of your mind
'Cause you know I'll be right there beside you
Riding through all these western nights

I haven't spoken to my daddy in a long, long time
I don't want him to worry, always wondering if I'm alright
But the neighborhood keeps getting smaller
All starved out when the money's paper thin
All that's left are your walls and you'll die there
I should have known that there's no getting in
Trouble's always gonna find you baby
But so will I
Crying only because I'm happy
Hold me across every state line
I'm never gonna leave you baby
Even if you lose what's left of your mind
'Cause you know I'll still be right behind you
Riding through all these western nights

Through these western nights
Crying in the light of the TV static
I'll still be alright
Clinging onto you like some love blind addict
I'll be screaming your name
Past the gas stations, trailing down the interstate
Please don't love how I need you
And know that one day, you and I could be 

[Trackname: Family Tree]

These crosses all over my body
Remind me of who I used to be
Give myself up to him in offering
Let him make a woman out of me
I'm just a child but I'm not above violence
My mama raised me better than that
When the preacher talks, that man demands his silence
And daddy said shoot first then run and don't look back

So take me down to the river and bathe me clean
Put me on the back of your white horse to ride
All the way to thе chapel, let you wash all over mе

I've killed before and I'll kill again
Take the noose off, wrap it tight around my hand
They say heaven hath no fury like a woman scorned
And baby, hell don't scare me, I've been times before

So take me down to the river and bathe me clean
Put me on the back of your white horse to ride
All the way to the chapel, let you wash all over me
These crosses all over my body
Remind me of who I used to be
Let Christ forgive these bones I've been hiding
And the bones I'm about to leave

And take me down to the river and bathe me clean
Put me on the back of your white horse to ride
All the way to the chapel, let you wash all over 

[Trackname: Hard Times]

Hide me there
Under the leaves
Nine going on eighteen
Lay it on me
Tell me a story
About how it ends
Where you're still the good guy
I'll make pretend
'Cause I hate this story
Where happiness ends
And dies with you

I thought good guys get to be happy
I'm not happy
I am poison in the water and unhappy
Little girl who needs her daddy real bad

In the corner
On my birthday
You watched me
Dancing right there in the grass
I was too young
To noticе
That some types of love could bе bad
Praying I'd be like you
Doing all of the things that you do
And I still do
And that scares me
I'm tired of you, still tied to me
(Bleeding whenever you want)
Too tired to move, too tired to leave
I'm tired of you, still tied to me
(It's just the way that you are)
I'm tired of you, too tired to leave
(I just wanna sleep)
I'm tired of you, still tied to me
(I just wanna sleep)
Too tired to move, too tired to leave
(I just wanna sleep)
I'm tired of you, still tied to me
(Please, can I sleep, can I sleep?)
I'm tired of you, too tired to leave
I'm tired of you, still tied to me
Too tired to move, too tired to 

[Trackname: Thoroughfare]

You fell in love with America when you were twelve years old
And by seventeen, you knew you had to see it all
You loved your dad and the love he had for your mother, so
You had to get out and go chasin' its sweet call

I met you there in Texas somewhere on the thoroughfare
On the side of the road in some torn-up clothes with a pistol in my pocket
I didn't trust no one, but you said, "Baby, don't run, I'll take you anywhere"
So I hopped right in, outta luck to spend, and at least your truck beats walking

And you said, "Hey, do you wanna see thе west with me?
'Cause lovе's out there and I can't leave it be"
And I said, "Honey, love's never meant much to me
But I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need"

So we made off for California
To find your lover, drivin' day and night
And every small town diner
Saw our faces at least once or twice
But in these motel rooms
I started to see you differently, oh
'Cause for the first time since I was a child
I could see a man who wasn't angry
And he said, "It's been a long damn time since I left Florida
No one left to leave and no one left to love
But now that I met you, I finally know just where I'm headin'"
And we found heaven in time where your western sunshine
Met my deep southern wet
And you got lost in it and yet you found yourself
Hard-pressed for air and sweatin'

And you said, "Hey, do you wanna see the west with me?
(Do you wanna see the west with me?)
'Cause love's out there and I can't leave it be"
(I can't leave it, I can't leave it)
And I said, "Honey, love's never meant that much to me
(Nothing much)
But I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need"

And once we reached the coast, you said, "End of the line
We finally reached the edge after all this time
I didn't find my love, but I still made it this far without it"
And then you turned to me and stared into me deep
And said, "Well, maybe not 'cause look at what I've got
You might not be my love, but, baby, I doubt it"
And you said, "Hey, do you wanna see the west with me?
'Cause love's out there and I can't leave it be"
(I can't leave it, I can't leave it)
And I said, "Honey, love's never meant that much to me
But I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need"

'Cause in your pickup truck with all of your dumb luck is the only place I think I'd ever wanna be

[Trackname: Gibson Girl]

You wanna love me right now
You wanna get alone with me
You wanna get my clothes off
And hurt me
You came alone to me
From however far away
Asking me to know how I know
You're all the same

Black leather and dark glasses
Pouring another while I shake my ass
He's cold-blooded so it takes more time to bleed
Obsession with the money, addicted to the drugs
Says he's in love with my body, that's why he's fucking it up
And then he says to me

"Baby, if it feels good
Then it can't be bad"
Where I can be immoral
In a stranger's lap
And if you want it good
Downright iconic
Something they all want
That only you can have
You wanna fuck me right now
You wanna see me on my knees
You wanna rip these clothes off
And hurt me

And if you hate me
Please don't tell me
Just let the lights bleed
All over me

If it feels good
Then it can't be bad
Where I can be immoral
In a stranger's lap
And if you want it good
Downright iconic
Then I would show you something
You can never have

And if it feels good
Then it can't be bad
Where I can be immoral
In a stranger's lap
And if you want it good
Downright iconic
Then I would show you something
You can never have
You wanna love me right now
You wanna love me right now
You wanna fuck me right now
You wanna—
You wanna love me right now
You wanna love me right now
You wanna fuck me, fuck me
You wanna love me, love me
You wanna—5

[Trackname: Ptolemaea]
I followed you in
I was with you there
I invited you in
Twice, I did
You love blood too much
But not like I do
Not like I do
Heard you, saw you, felt you, gave you
Need you, love you, love you, love you
Heard you, saw you, felt you, gave you
Need you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, saw you, love you, gave you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, saw you, felt you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
(You’d do wеll to say yes to me)
Suffer doеs the wolf, crawling to thee
Promising a big fire, any fire
Saying I'm the one, he's gonna take me
I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire
Suffering is nigh, drawing to me
Calling me the one, I'm the white light
Beautiful, finite
Even the iron still fears the rot
Hiding from something I cannot stop
Walking on shadows, I can't lead him back
Buckled on the floor when night comes along
Daddy's left and Mama won't come home
You poor thing
Sweet, mourning lamb
There's nothing you can do
It's already been done
What fear a man like you brings upon (Show me your face)
A woman like me
Please don't look at me
I can see it in your eyes
He keeps looking at me
Tell me, what have you done
Stop, stop, stop, make it stop, stop
Make it stop
Make it stop, I've had enough
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
I am the face of love's rage
I am the face of love's rage
Blessed be the Daughters of Cain, bound to suffering eternal through the sins of their fathers committed long before their conception
Blessed be their whore mothers, tired and angry waiting with bated breath in a ferry that will never move again
Blessed be the children, each and every one come to know their god through some senseless act of violence
Blessed be you, girl, promised to me by a man who can only feel hatred and contempt towards you
I am no good nor evil, simply I am, and I have come to take what is mine
I was there in the dark when you spilled your first blood
I am here now as you run from me still
Run then, child
You can't hide from me 

[Trackname: Sun Bleached Flies]

Sun bleached flies sitting in the windowsill
Waiting for the day they escape
They talk all about that money and how their babies are always changing while they're breathing in the poison of the paint
What I wouldn't give to be in Church this Sunday
Listening to the choir, so heartfelt, all singing
God loves you, but not enough to save you
So, baby girl, good luck taking care of yourself

So I said fine, 'cause that's how my daddy raised me
If they strike once then you just hit 'em twice as hard
But in the end, if I bend under the weight that they gave me
Then this heart would break and fall as twice as far

We all know how it goes
The more it hurts, the less it shows
But I still feel like they all know, and that's why I can never go back home
And I spend my life watching it go by from the sidelines
And God, I've tried, but I think it's about time I put up a fight

But I don't mind 'cause that's how my daddy raised me (How my daddy raised me)
If they strike once then you just hit 'em twice as hard
But I always knew that in the end no one was coming to save me
So I just prayed and I keep praying and praying and praying
If it's meant to be then it will be
So I met him there and told him I believe
Singing if it's meant to be then it'll be
I forgive it all as it comes back to me (Back to me)
If it's meant to be then it will be
So I met him there and told him I believe (I believe, yeah)
Singing if it's meant to be then it will be (Oh, oh)
I forgive it all as it comes back to me (It comes back to me)
If it's meant to be then it'll be (It'll be, it'll be, it'll be)
So I met him there and told him I believe (Yeah)
Singing if it's meant to be then it will be
I forgive it all as it comes back to me (Oh)

I'm still praying for that house in Nebraska
By the highway, out on the edge of town
Dancing with the windows open
I can't let go when something's broken
It's all I know and it's all I want 

[Trackname: Strangers]

"God is telling you and I there is death, for all of us
But then we find that the scriptures also tell us that we have a great promise, that there is a better place for those who believe in the lord Jesus Christ"

In your basement, I grow cold
Thinking back to what I was always told
"Don't talk to strangers or you might fall in love"
Freezer bride, your sweet divine
You devour like smoked bovine hide
How funny, I never considered myself tough
You're so handsome, walking over to me now

I tried to be good
Am I no good?
Am I no good?
Am I no good?
With my memory restricted to a Polaroid in evidence
I just wanted to be yours
Can I be yours?
Can I be yours?
Just tell me I'm yours
If I'm turning in your stomach and I'm making you feel sick

Oh, no, no, no
No, no
No, no
When my mother sees me on the side
Of a milk carton in Winn-Dixie's dairy aisle
She'll cry and wait up for me
We'll make love in your attic all night
Euphoric in some strange delight
I'm happier here 'cause he told me I should be, oh
You're so handsome when I'm all over your mouth
(When I'm all over your mouth, when I'm all over your mouth)

I tried to be good
Am I no good?
Am I no good?
Am I no good?
With my memory restricted to a Polaroid in evidence
I just wanted to be yours
Can I be yours?
Can I be yours?
Just tell me I'm yours
If I'm turning in your stomach and I'm making you feel sick
Am I making you feel sick?

Ah
Am I making you feel sick?
Am I making you feel
Am I making you feel sick?
Am I making you feel
Am I making you feel sick?
Am I making you feel sick?
Am I making you feel sick?
Am I making you feel sick?
No
Found you just to tell you that I made it real far
And that I never blamed you for loving me the way that you did
While you were torn apart
I would still wait with you there
Don't think about it too hard
Or you'll never sleep a wink at night again
Don't worry 'bout me and these green eyes
Mama, just know that I love you (I do)
And I'll see you when you get
