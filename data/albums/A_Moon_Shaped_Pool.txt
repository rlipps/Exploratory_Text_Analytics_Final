[Trackname: Burn the Witch]

Stay in the shadows
Cheer at the gallows
This is a round-up

This is a low-flying panic attack
Sing the song on the jukebox that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live

Red crosses on wooden doors
If you float, you burn
Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers

This is a low-flying panic attack
Sing the song of sixpence that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
We know where you 

[Trackname: Daydreaming]

Dreamers
They never learn
They never learn
Beyond the point
Of no return
Of no return
Then it's too late
The damage is done
The damage is done

This goes
Beyond me
Beyond you
A white room
By a window
Where the sun comes
Through
We are
Just happy to serve
Just happy to serve
You

[Trackname: Decks Dark]

Then into your life, there comes a darkness
There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
And all we trapped rag doll cloth people
We are helpless to resist
Into our darkest hour

But it was just a laugh, just a laugh, just a laugh, just a laugh
Even at this angle, and so we crumble
A ten ton head made of wet sand, oh, this dread circumference
You've gotta be kidding me, the grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, in the glass, it was just a laugh, just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is, in split infinity

Then into your life, there comes a darkness
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Into your darkest hour
When you've had enough of me
When you've had enough of me
Sweet darling
When you've had enough of me
When you've had enough of me
Sweet darling
Sweet times
Sweet darling
Sweet 

[Trackname: Desert Island Disk]

Now as I go upon my way
So let me go upon my way
Born of a light, born of a light
The wind rushing 'round my open heart
An open ravine with my spirit wide
Totally alive and my spirit light
Through an open doorway
Across a street to another life
And catching my reflection
In a window, switching on a light
One I didn't know, totally alive, totally released

Waking, waking up from shutdown
From a thousand years of sleep
Yeah, you, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Standing on the edge of
You, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean

Different types of love

[Trackname: Ful Stop]


You really messed up everything
You really messed up everything
If you could take it all back again
Strike up the tinderbox
Why should I be good if you're not?
This is a foul tasting medicine
A foul tasting medicine
To be trapped in your full stop

Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
Truth will mess you up

Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
When you take me back
Take me back again
Will you take me back
Take me back again

You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time
You really messed up
You really messed up

[Trackname: Glass Eyes]

Hey, it's me, I just got off the train
A frightening place, the faces are concrete grey
And I'm wondering, should I turn around?
Buy another ticket? The panic is coming on strong
So cold, from the inside out
No great drama, message coming in
In the oh-so-smug glassy eyed light of day
Glassy eyed light of day

Where the path trails off and heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
And I don't really care
Where the path trails off and heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
And I don't really care

I feel this love to the core
I feel this love turn 

[Trackname: Identikit]

A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be
Oh, me
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be
Oh, me
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be
Oh, me

The sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all
The sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all

But now I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want
When I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want to know
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain

The pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create, that we can
The pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create

But when I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want
When I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want to 

[Trackname: The Numbers]

It holds us like a phantom
It toucheslike a breeze
It shines its understanding
See, the moon is smiling
Open on all channels
Ready to receive
'Cause we're not at the mercy
Of your chimeras and spells
Your chimeras and spells
Mm-hmm
We are of the earth
To her we do return
The future is inside us
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else

(One day at a time)
One day at a time

We call upon the people
The people have this power
The numbers don't decide
The system is a lie
A river running dry
The wings of butterflies
And you may pour us away like soup
Like we're pretty broken flowers
We'll take back what is ours
Take back what is ours
One day at a 

[Trackname: Present Tense]

This dance, this dance
Is like a weapon, is like a weapon
Of self-defence, of self-defence
Against the present, against the present
The present tense
No, I won't get heavy, don't get heavy
Keep it light and keep it moving
I am doing no harm
As my world comes crashing down
I'll be dancing, freaking out
Deaf, dumb, and blind

In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost

I won't turn around or the penny drops
Won't stop now, won't slack off
Or all this love will be in vain
To stop from falling down a mine
It's no one's business but mine
Where all this love has been in vain

In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm 

[Trackname: Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor Rich Man Poor Man Beggar Man Thief]

All the holes at once
Are comin' alive, set free
Out of sight and out of mind
The lonely and their prey

The ones you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say "Yes"

All the birds stay up in the trees
All the fish swim down to the deep
The lonely and their prey
I am here, come to me before it's too late

The one you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say "Yes"


[Trackname: True Love Waits]

I'll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet

Just don't leave
Don't leave

I'm not living
I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile

Just don't leave
Don't leave

And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps
Just don't leave
Don't
