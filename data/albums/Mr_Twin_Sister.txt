[Trackname: Sensitive]
You’ve given me affection,
It’s never enough,
Reflections to hold,
Abilities to hold in the mind,
A memory,
A memory to keep,
To know by heart,
What’s precious to me,
I can’t remember you but you know it,
I’ve forgotten everything.
Finding out the actual year made me realize how much happier I was not knowing,
I’m heavily distracted
Is this just an illusion?
Is this romantic dreaming?
Is this romantic dreaming?
I’ve forgotten everything.
Blow my sorrows away,
Warm my cold heart,
I want to recognize you but I don’t know who you are,
Is this romantic dreaming?
Is this just an illusion?
Is this romantic dreaming?
A memory?
I’ve forgotten everything.

[Trackname: Rude Boy]

I don't really want to get to know you
I don't really want to catch your first name
I've got all the drinks that I can handle
Stop telling me so much about yourself

What makes you so certain
That I want to be forced to notice you
You're not even aware of what a bore you are
Too vain to even read what I'm thinking

Oye rude boy, is that all?
How'd you get this way?
All you are is face
You need to be everything if you want anything

I can’t seem to understand who’d like this
I can’t have you hang around much longer
You can’t seem to get enough attention
You could give someone else your number

Oye rude boy, must you go on?
My mind's been made
All you are is face
You need to be everything if you want anything

Oye rude boy, I've had enough
I don't fall for that
Do you have a heart?
You need to feel something inside if you want anything

[Trackname: In the House of Yes]

I slipped up, felt the echo of a memory rise up and disappear from me
Fill my cup, now that I’ve had two or three, I can get a little free
It feels good, to celebrate the loss of my independence
I’m in the mood, to let the rhythm push me out of my head
(You're the one)

I’m lit up, dancing in my room alone I lock my door and turn off my phone
Fill my cup, now that I’ve had three or four, I could use a couple more
It feels good, to tune out from the wrongs of the world around me
I’m in the mood, to let the warm embrace of my cup surround me
(You're the one)

I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em

I’m fucked up, but I think I could have some more if I could get myself off the floor
Spilled my cup, the room is tipping to and fro, my mind is moving kinda slow
I know I should, break out of these walls I have built around me
If only I could, face up to the world let the truth surround me
(You're the one)

(You're the one)

[Trackname: Blush]

Could you be near me?
There's something that I need to say
It's kind of a strange thing
Just tell me that it's okay

Have you ever felt like
You would always be alone?
Like no matter what you do
You'd always feel this hole?

If you could just read me
I would make everything right
Inside there's a real me
Who's been shying away from the light
Don't you believe me?
Are you alright?
Is there even a real me
Or am I just a series of nights?

Blush
Blush
Now you have my secrets
But you haven't said a thing
Show me your darkness
Let my shadow take you in

Have you ever felt like
You would always be alone?
Like no matter what you do
You'd always feel this hole?

If you could just read me
I would make everything right
Inside there's a real me
Who's been shying away from the light
Don't you believe me?
Are you alright?
Is there even a real me
Or am I just a series of nights

[Trackname: Out of the Dark]

A place that someone knew
A little city
Red lights
Beam up our way, wish upon a star
Out of the dark
It's someone new
A thrill, mesmerized
A smile, behind her hands
Seeing other girls
The lip stick, the tiny skirts
Blow them a kiss

I am a woman but inside I'm a man
And I want to be as gay as I can


A thrill, mesmerized
A smile, behind her hands
Seeing other girls
The lip stick, the tiny skirts
Blow them a kiss
A place that someone knew
A little city
Street tunnel
Beam up our way, wish upon a star
Out of the dark
It's someone new

Whatever happen to poor dear me?
Never see that face again
I don't want to leave
No one wants to leave
Funny how things have to end
(Whatever happened)
Whatever happened to poor dear me? (To poor dear me)
Never see that face again
I don't want to leave
No one wants to leave
Funny how things have to end

You're pushing on my identity
How much longer do I get to be
This version of me
You're pushing on my identity
How much longer do I get to be
This version of me

[Trackname: Twelve Angels]
Walking into the billiards, alone in drag
Hours on , no ID in my bag
And the only light is the red open sign
Twelve angels, per three tables, lined in four lines
I'm here in midnight bioluminous
Twelve angels, one for each table
And the red open sign
Here in midnight bioluminous
I've fallen for an illusion
An instinctual cry for change
And I promised myself no more confusion
No more thoughts to derange
And as i sink into my vinyl chair
Someone tries to look it through me
I choose light to turn its way
And let the dark matter into me
I've fallen for an illusion
I see peers of mine staring my way
Drippy canine eyes
Trying to look it through me
And what do I do I turn
Tightly its way
And let the dark matter into me
What more can I say?
I've fallen for an illusion
Told myself no more confusion
Somewhere there's a chord sitting in the air for me
But tonight I don't wanna care for me

[Trackname: Crime Scene]
Bloodhounds tied in seaweed
Bloodhounds in green chains
Picnic on the river, witness claimed
Hair was found at the foot of the woods
One watcher knew it well
Pushing through the line of the cops
To get closer
All I wanna do is be tied to you
Terror through each quiet night
Up and then I'm down thinking I'm dying
Then back up where I forget
Sicker than I've ever been, these nightmares I'm having
