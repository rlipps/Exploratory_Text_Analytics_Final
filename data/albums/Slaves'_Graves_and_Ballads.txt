[Trackname: Somberly, Kimberly]
I read the furrows in their brow and between the lines of our ageless faces; the way it braces on a man of forty surely means something.
Jacketed diplomats, the conferring like a chorus of walrus, or a wall with dryers in the laundromat rumbling in sonorous unison.
There in me.
The souped-up Hondas stalled in traffic on Bruneside, burping their subwoof like a council of bullfrogs.
Somberly, Kimberly, they install the settling evening.

[Trackname: On the Beach]

On the beach
The sun bleached the gathered forms
With coats and ties and sighs all formal
They waited for me
Blackened backs facing

I waited for their formation to break
As a welcoming smile breaks
And is disarming
I waited for their hail

But the committee did not turn
I grew aware that they knew that I was there
Were retorts, but no one cared
Were retorts, but no one cared

I waited for their formation to break
As a welcoming smile breaks
And is disarming
I waited for their hail
I waited for their hail

[Trackname: (Throw On) The Hazard Lights]

I'm not going to work
Just like the sparks from off my bumper
Scraping as it trails
Behind me
Resigning

Throw on the hazard lights
Pull on over to the side
Slowly figure what the problem is
Or it's all over before it begins

Oh you
Will raise your voice
When it won't meet you where you hoped it would
Don't bother with your peers
Their knowledge is weird

Throw on the hazard lights
Pull on over to the side
Slowly figure what the problem is
Or it's all over before it begins

[Trackname: Slaves' Graves]

Coming, becoming
As we landscape the landscape
Finding shrubs better than hedges
To express our good nature

These are the feelings of slaves
All spiraling upward
Interior monocots whose rage
Expressed in slogans
Slumps itself feet up back to the urn
Slumps itself feet up back to the urn

Wood chips are chainmail
Against another feeling
Those seedlings that would crack pavement to exist banally

These are the feelings of slaves
All spiraling upward
Interior monocots whose rage
Expressed in slogans
The way a logo different from an icon
The way a logo different from an icon

[Trackname: Grandfather's Hanging]
The skyline is darker than the sky at night
Like you are a black hole
In time, in westward way
Like aerospace umbilical cords
We will consume the universe
Outside in the sun, the siding through the shadow into zig-zag
Its reflections exposed the bad posture that chiropractice
Corrected during waking hours
Corrected during waking hours
Rivers to the sea, like shy wolves to the dance floor, swim the corridor

[Trackname: We Are Swaddled]
We are swaddled in soft bath towels
I will smother the next-born son with pillows

[Trackname: A Labor More Restful]

You are finally convinced
That you inhabit
The same banal world as everyone
Everyone has found it too
Everyone has resigned themselves
To it

And the only mystery
Is in what you couldn't decide
Or remember clearly
The only mystery
Is in what you couldn't decide or remember
Decide or remember

Have you stopped looking
In order to put yourself
To some real purpose?
Or have you simply found
A labor more restful
Than big-hearted yearning
And knowing that you're incomplete?
And the only mystery
Is in what you couldn't decide
Or remember clearly
The only mystery is in what you couldn't decide
Or remember
Decide
Or remember

[Trackname: Unmoved]
The leaves hang limp
And motionless
And the hairs on my arm
Rest against my skin
Unmoved
The whispering wind
Of a moment ago
They are still for now
They are still just now
And in the silence
I swear to God
I can hear the sounds
Of the interstate
Unmoved
The softer shell
I ate somedays ago
Was fried and battered
Soggy and compromised
Now I carry a basket
Of exoskeletons
Down the road I'm on
Unmoved

[Trackname: Ladies, You Have Exiled Me]
Ladies, you have exiled me
Oh No, I guess I did that to me
Sleep
Sleep
Sleep now, close your eyes
Dream, dream away this night
Sleep
Sleep
Sleep now, close your eyes
Dream, dream away this night
I need to sleep a long, long, time
A long, long, long time

[Trackname: Because Your Light Is Turning Green]

When you and the stoplight collide high
And then you see your friend walking on the shoulder
Do you call her over?

'Cause don't you know that it's selfish?
Because your light is turning green
'Cause don't you know that it's selfish?
Because your light is turning green

When you and I walk each other back
Do you make eye contact?
No, you avert your eyes
They don't meet mine

'Cause don't you know that it's dangerous?
Because my light is turning green
Because my light is turning green

[Trackname: Obscure Wisdom]
The only instance of your poor judgement
Would be to mistrust it
Mistrust the superior wisdom of your body
Beautiful and pure
Obscure, but sure
Manhattan will take you
But let it be in a while
Manhattan will take you
But let it be in a while

[Trackname: This Weather]
When I start to feel this way
I might as well call it a day
When I start to feel this way
I can only wonder
What is this weather I'm under?
What is this weather I'm under?

[Trackname: Since I Opened]
How long has it been since I opened up my heart?
