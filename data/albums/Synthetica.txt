[Trackname: Artificial Nocturne]

I'm just as fucked up as they say
I can't fake the daytime
I found an entrance to escape into the dark
Got false lights for the sun
It's an artificial nocturne
It's an outsider's escape for a broken heart

We hide out in the back
Like shadows in a stranger's dream
Hiding out in the back together
Hiding out in the back forever

I make all that I believe
In dreams so real
Babe, I have to take the call
Fate don't fail me now
I make all that I believe
I set myself free
So take all the time you need
And let yourself be

I'm as fucked up as they say
I can't fake the daytime
I found an entrance to escape into the dark
Got false lights for the sun
It's an artificial nocturne
An outsider's escape for a broken heart
I'm as far gone as they say
I can't fake the daytime
I found an entrance to escape into the dark
Got false lights for the sun
It's an artificial nocturne
An outsider's escape for a broken heart

[Trackname: Youth Without Youth]

Hangman, we played
Rubber soul with a razor blade
Behind the church, hiding place
It was a long joke 'til the punch line came
Can you read my mind?
Read my mind
Follow along to the end of the song

Hangman, we played
Double dutch with a hand grenade
Behind the church, hiding place
Apathetic to the Devil's face
Wear the sheriff's badge, put your toys away
They let us go saying, "Let us pray!"

Youth without youth
Youth without youth

Hangman, we played
Hide and seek on the fire escape
Through the smoke, we saw the flame
It was a long wait 'til the firetruck came
On the count of three, jump with me
On the count of three
One... two...
One... two... three... Go!
Youth without youth
Youth without youth
Go, go, go, go!
Go!
Youth without youth
Youth without youth
Go, go, go, go!

Hangman, we played
Blind man's bluff with the 9th brigade
Throw the brick through the windowpane
Double dutch 'til they stop the game
'Til the cops show up
Handcuff stunned
They let us go but we lost one!

Hangman, we played
Blind man's bluff 'til they stopped the game
Youth without youth
Born without time
Youth without youth
Can you read my mind?
Youth without youth
Youth without youth
My, my, my, my!
My, my, my, my!
Youth without youth
Youth without youth
My, my, my, my

[Trackname: Speed The Collapse]

All the way from where we came
Built a mansion in a day
Distant lightning, thunder claps
Watched our neighbor's house collapse
Looked the other way
And then, the storm was overhead
All the oceans boiled and rivers bled
We auctioned off our memories
In the absence of a breeze
Scatter what remains
Scatter what remains

Pushed away, I'm pulled toward
A comedown of revolving doors
Every warning we ignored
Drifting in from distant shores
The wind presents a change of course
A second reckoning of sorts
We were wasted, waiting for
A comedown of revolving doors

Fate don't fail me now
And when the days that followed passed
In another mansion built to last
From our window, we could see
Only possibilities down the road and back
But then, the storm returned for more
In a comedown of revolving doors
Auctioned off our memories
In the absence of a breeze
Scatter what remains
Scatter what remains

Pushed away, I'm pulled toward
A comedown of revolving doors
Every warning we ignored
Drifting in from distant shores
The wind presents a change of course
A second reckoning of sorts
We were wasted, waiting for
A comedown of revolving doors

Fate don't fail me now
Fate don't fail me now
Fate don't fail me now
Fate don't fail me now
Fate don't fail me 

[Trackname: Breathing Underwater]

I'm the blade
You're the knife
I'm the weight
You're the kite
They were right when they said
We were breathing underwater
Out of place, all the time
In a world that wasn't mine to take
I'll wait

Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?
Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?

I'm the blade
You're the knife
I'm the weight
You're the kite
They were right when they said
We should never meet our heroes
When they bow at their feet, in the end, it wasn't me
Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?
Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?

Nights are days
We'll beat a path through the mirrored maze
I can see the end
But it hasn't happened yet
I can see the end
But it hasn't happened yet

Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?
Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?

Am I breathing underwater?
Am I breathing underwater

[Trackname: Dreams So Real]

When I get to the bottom of it, I sink
Seems like nothing I said
Ever meant anything
But a headline over my head
Thought I made a stand
Only made a scene
There's no feast for the underfed
All the unknown, dying or dead
Keep showing up in my dreams
They stand at the end of my bed
Have I ever really helped anybody but myself?
To believe in the power of songs
To believe in the power of girls
Though the point we're making is gone
Play it stripped down to my thong

I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
Our parents, daughters and sons
Believed in the power of songs
What if those days are gone?
My memory is strong
Anyone not dying is dead
And baby, it won't be long
So shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn

I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn

Baby, wherever you are
Baby, whatever you do
Faster than you think, time staggers on

[Trackname: Lost Kitten]

Don't say yes if you can't say no
Victim of the system, say it isn't so
Squatted on the doorstep, swallowed all the blow
Leaving without you, can't say no
Halfway starts with happiness for me
Halfway house, lost kitten in the street
Hit me where it hurts, I'm coming home to lose
Kitten on the catwalk, high-heeled shoes
No more hot-headed Saturdays
They got it, they want it, they give it away
Tell me one thing you would never do
I was looking for a hooker when I found you

You've got my eyes, you've got my eyes
You'll never be mine, ah, but you've got my eyes

When you lie, I cover it up
When you hide, I cover it up
When you cry, I cover it up
When you come undone, I cover it up

So pent up, I was coming on to you
Happy in the night time, howlin' at the moon
Sippin' on a cocktail, drinking in the loo
There's something about you I hold on to
You've got my eyes, you've got my eyes
You'll never be mine, ah, but you've got my eyes

When you lie, I cover it up
When you hide, I cover it up
When you cry, I cover it up
When you're blind, I cover it up
When you lie, I cover it up
When you hide, I cover it up
When you cry, I cover it up
When you come undone, I cover it up

They got it, they want it, they give it away
They got it, they want it, they give it away
They got it, they want it, they give it away
They got it, they want it, they give it away

When you lie, I cover it up
When you hide, I cover it up
When you cry, I cover it up
When you come undone, I cover it 

[Trackname: The Void]

All night, like a child
I stayed up to prove
I can keep up
All night, like a fool
I stayed up to prove
I can keep up with you

All night
(Made a plan, it was grand, but you're still in the void)
All night
(Sing along with the band, you're losing your voice)
All night
(Made a plan, it was grand, but you're bored by choice)
All night
(Sing along with the band, but you're still in the void)

What can I say?
I stay up to prove
I can keep up
I stayed up to prove
I can keep up with you

All night
(Made a plan, it was grand, but you're still in the void)
All night
(Sing along with the band, you're losing your voice)
All night
(Made a plan, it was grand, but you're bored by choice)
All night
(Sing along with the band, but you're still in the void)
(All night, all night)

What can I say?
I stay up to prove
I can keep up with you

All night
(Made a plan, it was grand, but you're still in the void)
All night
(Sing along with the band, you're losing your voice)
All night
(Made a plan, it was grand, but you're bored by choice)
All night
(Sing along with the band, but you're still in the void)
All night
(Sing along with the band, but you're still in the void)

[Trackname: Synthetica]

Some of us are wild ones
Ever under wanted, I believe
Lining up in the background
Waiting for the crowd shot to be seen
In the shadow of the big screen
Everybody begs to be redeemed

Hey, I'm not synthetica
I'll keep the life that I've got

We were never meant to
Crawl in for the bait
We never will
I can think for myself
I've got something no pill could ever kill

Hey, I'm not synthetica
I'll keep the life that I've got
So hard, hard to resist synthetica
No drug is stronger than me
Synthetica
We're all the time confined to fit the mold
But I won't ever let them make a loser of my soul

Hey, I'm not synthetica
I'll keep the life that I've got
I'll keep the life that I've got
I'll keep the life that I've got
I'll keep the life that I've got

[Trackname: Clone]

Call me out
My regret
Only makes me
Stronger yet

Nothing I've ever done right
Happened on the safe side
It's the other way
I'm missing everyone I know now

It's too late in the day, too late in the day
To take you on all the rides
I was afraid to tell you that

Back to that
Photograph
Can you clone me?
I look like everyone you know now

It's too late in the day, too late in the day
To turn it around or change my mind
It's too late in the day
To take you on all the rides
It's too late in the day
To tell me I'm off the path
We're already in the aftermath
Call me out
My regret
Only makes me
Stronger yet

It's too late in the day, too late in the day
To turn it around or change my mind
It's too late in the day
To take you on all the rides
It's too late in the day
To tell me I'm off the path
We're already in the aftermath

[Trackname: The Wanderlust]

I've been sleepwalking through the railway station
Wake me up when they call my destination
Where I've been, I was bound to leave behind
All device and all disease was mine
(Oh, oh) Speeding out of reach
(Oh, oh) You're the one I had to meet

I never wanted to go home
The wanderlust will carry us on
There was nothing there for me
The wanderlust will carry us on
In a high rise on my own
I've been on the prince of highways for so long
Looking out at a mirror balcony
Wanderlust will carry us on
Will there ever be a place for you and me?
Wanderlust
I'm rolling in for a seven day weekend
Living up again to my old reputation
Can you cover me?
'Cause I got no armor
Keep on moving down the line, keep on going further
(Oh, oh) Speeding out of reach
(Oh, oh) You're the one I had to meet

I never wanted to go home
Wanderlust will carry us on
There was nothing there for me
Wanderlust will carry us on
In a high rise on my own
I've been on the prince of highways for so long
Looking out at a mirror balcony
Wanderlust will carry, carry, carry us on
I don't know where to go now, I got nowhere to hide
Nowhere to go, nowhere to be
I don't know where to go now, I got nowhere to be
Oh, wanderlust will carry us on
Walk fifty city blocks down but they always find us
Wanderlust will carry us on
Will there ever be a place for you and me?
Wanderlust will carry us on
Will there ever be a place for you and me?

[Trackname: Nothing But Time]

Steal once, pay twice
Advice to heed
I won't, I might
Advice to heed
Steal once, pay twice
Advice to heed
I won't, I might
Advice to heed

Steal once, pay twice
Advice to heed
I won't, I might

Steal once, pay twice

We always said that love was not enough
We're always on the move
(Advice to heed)
And even though we longed to shut it off
We could never choose
(Advice to heed)
Now we know there's nothing awaiting us
Better than the truth
(Advice to heed)
I wanted to be part of something
I've got nothing but time
So the future is mine
(Advice to heed)
I wanted to be part of something
I've got nothing but time
So the future is mine

I wanted to be part of something
I've got nothing but time
So the future is mine
