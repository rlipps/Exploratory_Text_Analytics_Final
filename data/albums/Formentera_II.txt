[Trackname: Detour Up]

Get half the way civilized, take a turn
Run naked through the hallways
Free your mind, people change
Start to lie like fur beside the fireplace
Soft and light, honest hands
Hard to say how I got here in the first place
Tell the wives we're running late

I took a detour up, a detour up
It wasn't in my plans but nothing was
I took a detour up, a detour up
The map was in the hands of none of us
I took a detour up, a detour up
It wasn't in my plans, nothing was
I took a detour up, a detour up
I don't know where I am, do all I can

Take the rough terrain by candlelight
Purple haze, bedroom eyes
Spiral like a staircase endlessly
What's the use asking why
Leave mystery alone, don't analyze
Chalk it up to lust for life
Dropped to the deepest strange unfamiliar place
But i can't imagine going any other way

I took a detour up, a detour up
It wasn't in my plans but nothing was
I took a detour up, a detour up
The map was in the hands of none of us
I took a detour up, a detour up
It wasn't in my plans, nothing was
I took a detour up, a detour up
I don't know where I am, do all I can
(Detour up, Detour up)
(Detour up, Detour up)

[Trackname: Just The Once]

Seems at the time, it will be just the once
And even I used to be innocent once
I couldn't wait, get us out of this place
Before once becomes once in a while

Soon it's a race, it's a rush and a high
Steal an embrace, it starts with one little lie
Try once again to redefine now and then
Before once becomes once in a while

Said it would be just the once
Said it would bе just the once
Said it would be just for fun
Said it would bе just for fun
Just the once

Once you arrive, there's only so far to fall
Ask how you got here, it gets hard to recall
Head for the door, it pulls you back in once more
Baby, once becomes once in a while

Said it would be just the once
Said it would be just the once
Said it would be just for fun
Said it would be just for fun
Just the once
Said it would be
Once
Once
Once
Though we trace the outline clearly
Of morality and honesty
We observe the outline rarely
And eventually, unknowingly
We erase the outline

What happens when the ground beneath disappears?
What once were days will feel like thousands of years
But who's to say it isn't better this way
Look at me, now I'm free, you'll survive

Said it would be just the once
Said it would be just the once
Said it would be just for fun
Said it would be just for fun
Just the once
Said it would be
Once
Once
Once

[Trackname: Stone Window]
Yesterday I left for tomorrow
There was nothing after today
If another planet would take me
I'd be glad to go
Wildflowers rise from the concrete
Dominion of the kingdom remains
Visions of existence beyond me
High above the hellscape below
I'd be glad to go
I'd be glad to go
I'd be glad to go
Oh
Stationed in another dimension
Illuminating arrows of light
Spirit limitations are lifting
Opening a stone window
If there's a parallel road
If there's a parallel road
Take the parallel road
Open the stone window
Open the stone window

Now I fix my gaze
On a golden age
That I know will come
That I know will come
Though the dense malaise
That defined those days
Dulled our senses numb
Still I fix my gaze
On a golden age
That I know will come
When the air will clear
And the sound we hear
Of a steady drum
Will grow ever near
Disenchanted years
Distant dead and gone
Distant dead and gone
Take the parallel road
Open the stone window
Open the stone window

[Trackname: Days Of Oblivion]

All the times that now and then appear as only dreams
All the stuff from way back when that’s coming up don’t self destruct
You don’t have to call for the wrecking ball
Or burn the world to ashes
All you have to do is ask me to
I’ll stop you where the descending stairs drop

I’ve unlocked all the doors
And I’ve lost all the keys
And I live in a mansion made up of memories
Bob said don’t look back
John said I don’t believe
Jerry said there are days between days

Days of oblivion
Days of oblivion
It turns out these were the days
It turns out these were the days
Days of oblivion
Days of oblivion
It turns out these were the days
The ashes of disaster drift to you
All your dreams of change are coming true
I know I need you
I know I need you
Don’t ever leave me
I’ll never leave you behind
I know you need me
The way I need you
I’ll never leave you
Don’t ever leave me behind
I know I need you
You know I need you
Don’t ever leave me
I’d never leave you behind
The way you need me
The way I need you
I’d never leave you
I’ll never leave you behind
No
No
No

I’ve unlocked all the doors
I’ll never find the keys
And I live in a mansion now made up of memories
Bob said don’t look back
John said I don’t believe
Jerry said there are days between days

Days of oblivion
Days of oblivion
It turns out these were the days
It turns out these were the days
Days of oblivion
Days of oblivion
It turns out these were the days
The ashes of disaster drift to you
At last you really see me
Oo, oo, ooooh
Oo, oo, ooooh

All the times that now and then appear as only dreams
All the stuff from way back when that’s coming up don’t self destruct
You don’t have to call for the wrecking ball
Or burn the world to ashes
All you have to do is ask me to
I’ll stop you where the descending stairs drop
All the things that now and then appear as only dreams
All the stuff from way back when that’s coming up don’t self destruct
You don’t have to call for the wrecking ball
Or burn the world to ashes
All you have to do is ask me to
I’ll stop you where the descending stairs drop

[Trackname: Who Would You Be For Me]
Coming on ever so strong
Coming off ever so weak
Coming off ever so wrong
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your mind
Still as the night
Coming up ever so fast
Burning off whiskey and weed
Coming off ever so deep
Rhyming every line
Ranting rapid-fire
Scripting the night
We met on the sixth of June
Two zero zero two
On the southbound subway
You said, what now?
The heat's absurd
The rest went unheard
And you already knew my name
I sang for you the softest tune
On the sixth of June
In the park at 10th and A
How's it go, now?
Thе saddest tune
On the sixth of Junе
In the park at 10th and A
Growing up ever so slow
Come of age ever so late
Planning my quiet escape
Trying to disappear
One day at a time
Leaving no sign
Putting off getting in line
Putting off knowing my place
Coming off ever so crazed
Ways of stopping time
Driving my willpower
Still as the night
We met on the sixth of June
Two zero zero two
When I served you attitude
And sometimes I'd serve you coffee too
With the overnight crew
Before they closed that café
I sang for you the softest tune
On the sixth of June
In the park at 10th and A
How's it go, now?
The saddest tune
On the sixth of June
In the park at 10th and A
This city's been mean to you lately
But when will you ever leave
I could be the girl for you
But who would you be for me
Be for me, oh

[Trackname: Suckers]

Summon some willpower to weather the walk
Don't run, suffer the three flights up
Some folks still willing to pay five bucks
Don't die in the meantime, love
Tone deaf dumb comment set the whole chain off
Insane levels of a violent mob
Shared it, clicking the bait, but i won't
Don't get it contaminated love

Hot not hot summer day but i'm cold
I'm coming down with the rain
I'm through with finding some other way
Every night in my room
Who's the product, me or you ?
Small opinions, commentators of what?
Puffed up, scroll the finance page by thumb
Take us for suckers, we suck it up
But not forever the beginnings come

The storm is not the wave
The heat is not the sun
The voice is not the call
The world behind a wall
The hands are not the touch
The eyes are not the view
The voice is not the call
The world behind a wall
The world behind a wall
The world behind a wall

If you feel so bad, bad about it
Then step out from behind the wall of the world
If you feel so bad, take a look from the outside
You've been staring at the wall never watching the world
If you feel so bad, bad about it
Then step out from behind the wall of the world
If you feel so bad, take a look from the outside
You've been staring at the wall never watching the world
Find another frequency, you remember the melody
There's something more beyond the wall of the world
If you feel so bad, bad about it
Step out from behind the wall of the world
You've been staring at the wall never watching the world
There's something more beyond the wall of the world

[Trackname: Nothing Is Perfect]

Nothing has come between us
Nothing is real, nothing is real
Nothing can hurt us
Nothing is full of suspense
Nothing reveals
Nothing is worth it
Nothing has come between us
Nothing provides, nothing provides

Nothing is perfect, it's endless, don't wait up for me
No fences, no exits, no lies
Nothing is perfect, it's gorgeous, the sky meets the sea
But nothing is perfect, nothing is perfect for me

Nothing has come between us
Nothing is wrong, nothing is wrong
Nothing is painless
Nothing has always been here, when nothing belongs
Nothing is wrong

Nothing is perfect, I earned it, all absence achieved
No fences, no exits, no lies
Nothing is perfect, it's gorgeous, the sky meets the sea
And nothing is perfect, nothing is perfect
Dissolve to fade
Dissolve to fade
Dissolve to fade
Dissolve to fade

Nothing, Nothing, Nothing
Nothing, Nothing, Nothing
Nothing, Nothing, Nothing
Nothing, Nothing, Nothing

[Trackname: Descendants]

I lie awake with a stomach ache
And the first man drowns
In the last man's tears
How many rounds of monogamy
Find me listing the glut of believers
I myself played the lottery
Blame myself in the cold with a fever
How much guilt can you tolerate
Count myself among liars and cheaters
Roughed up riding a tidal wave
Time is up for your favorite deceivers
Life or death hangs in instant change
Ripping the gun from the hands of the shooter

Seconds away from the end coming soonеr
Saving the day when I'm seconds away from thе end

No, I don't get mad retroactively
And I don't get caught in the spokes of the wheel
Kick back on the sidelines a better place
Damn sure I don't ask how they pack that arena
I once set foot out where no one would
I should pat myself on the back in the morning
But I lie awake with a stomach ache
Stuck in my ways and afraid of conforming
Stuck in my ways and afraid of conforming
Stuck in my ways and afraid of conforming
Stuck in my ways and afraid of conforming
It goes by in a rush and there's only so much you can change

Are there no descendants?
End of the sentence, all independent

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Trackname: Go Ahead And Cry]

I was floating on by with the morning on high
Like a girl in a song from the 70s
Every mirrored sunglass said hello as I passed
Not a thing in the world that should worry me
Suddenly

The sky is falling, oh
The sky is falling, oh
I wish this all was a lie
The sky is falling, oh
The sky is falling, oh
It’s not the wolf that will cry, cry
Go ahead and cry, cry
Go ahead and cry

I was floating along fine
What could go wrong?
I’m used to the solitude anyway
I was crisp and chill as a hundred dollar bill
Treat an overcast day like an overdue holiday
Call my mom, bake a cake, smoke a bong
Cook hot nice hash like it’s

Losing my mind
Losing my mind
I wish this all was a lie
The sky is falling, oh
The sky is falling, oh
It’s not the wolf that will cry, cry, cry
Go ahead and cry, cry
For everything we did
As we stalled and rushed
Mother nature is laughing at us
So go ahead and cry, cry
Go ahead and cry, cry
