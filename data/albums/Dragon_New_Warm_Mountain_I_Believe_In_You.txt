[Trackname: Change]

Okay

Change like the wind
Like the water, like skin
Change like the sky
Like the leaves, like a butterfly

Would you live forever, never die
While everything around passes?
Would you smile forever, never cry
While everything you know passes?

Death's like a door
To a place we've never been before
Death, like space
The deep sea, a suitcase

Would you stare forever at the sun
And never watch the moon rising?
Would you walk forever in the light
To never learn the secret of the quiet night?
Still like a stone
Like a hill, like home
Still, what I find
Is you are always on my mind

Could I feel happy for you
When I hear you talk with her like we used to?
Could I set everything free
When I watch you holding her the way you once held me?

Change like the sky
Like the leaves, like a butterfly
Death, like a door
To a place we've never been before

Would you live forever, never die
While everything around passes?
Would you smile forever, never cry

[Trackname: Time Escaping]

Cool
One, two, one, two, three, four

Electric waves, a rush of energy
Silent river pouring backward eternally
Through the phase and touch of entropy
Old age in the beginner
To hit the stage and blush wild, laughingly
Crush the rage and rush time tappingly
Call the name so much so vapidly
Dissolving into thin air
Turning the two-fork taped-up television
Into tunnel vision
Taking the new fork tactile as revision
Working the revision

Time escaping
Time escaping

There is no reason to go down alonе
Through distortion's secret telеphone
Separate contact separate
Poison in the ether
Swinging still incessant pendulum
Lavender, nettle, calendula
Separate, contact, concentrate
Drawing out the fever
Time escaping
Time escaping

Ether
Time
It's music
It's music, Oso

Only the winter wind survives
After the heat rush feeds and thrives
After the bushfire burns and dies
Frozen and bitter
Desert ground so cold and clean
Spreading out like a magazine
Reading the dirt like gossip
What do the weeds say? They say
"Everything, everything, everything falls through
Each dimension breaks in two
Like the two hands clapping
Like the two wings flapping
Everything, everything, everything for free
As it all eventually
Turns to dust and petal
Molten rock and meadow"
Time escaping
Time 

[Trackname: Spud Infinity]

What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take
To free the celestial body?

From way up there, it looks so small
From way down here, it looks so small
One peculiar organism aren't we all together?
Everybody steps on ants
Everybody eats the plants
Everybody knows to dance, even with just one finger

What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take
To free the celestial body?

When I took another look
The past was not a history book
That was just some linear perception
Ash to ask and dust to dusk
A dime a dozen, aren't we just?
But a dozen dimes will buy a crust of garlic bread
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take
To free the celestial body?

When I say celestial
I mean extraterrestrial
I mean accepting the alien you've rejected in your own heart
When I say heart, I mean finish
The last one there is a potato knish
Baking too long in the sun of Spud Infinity
When I say infinity, I mean now
Kiss the one you are right now
Kiss your body up and down, other than your elbows
'Cause as for your elbows, they're on their own
Wandering like a rolling stone
Rubbing up against the edges of experience

What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take
To free the celestial body?


[Trackname: Certainty]

Name on the line, last request
Pull the car over to find some rest
Saying, "I love you"
Need to lie here, need to leave
Living in the debt of make-believe
Saying I owe you
Crooked as a crow gnawing on dawn
Shadow from the grass in the dirt on the lawn
Why do I string you along?

My certainty is wild, weaving
For you, I am a child, believing
You lay beside me sleeping on a plane
In the future

Sit on the phone, watch TV
Romance, action, mystery
Wanted to show you
Sine wave is a particle ride
Bring your light out, then in on the tide
Maybe I love you
Maybe I love you is a river so high
Maybe I love you is a river so low
I love you, still don't know
My certainty is wild, weaving
For you, I am a child, believing
You lay beside me sleeping on a plane
In the future

My certainty is wild, weaving
For you, I am a child, believing
You lay beside me sleeping on a plane
In the 

[Trackname: Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You]

It's a little bit magic
Like a river of morning geese
In the new warm mountain
Where the stone face forms and speaks

I believe in you
Even when you need to
Recoil

When the topsoil
Is kicking up into the storm
And the dust goes dancing
And a billion planets are born

I believe in you
Even when you need to
Recoil

Just like that
The moon goes flat
Big lights in the city shine
Crying out
Take me to the limits of your love

There's a dragon in thе phone line
Coughing up a mighty flame
With a tonguе of silver, silver
Calling out my oldest name

She says, "Hey, you
Do you remember me too?"
We were coiling

It's a little bit magic
Magic
A little bit magic


[Trackname: Sparrow]

Wrapped in the wings of a sparrow
Beak is as sharp as an arrow
Sings in a whispering whistle
Sleeps in the ivy and thistle
Owls out swooping and howling
Deep in the midnight a-prowling
Mama, the scream of the eagle
Threading my heart through the needle
Threading the blood through the apple
Sucking the juice from the apple
Eating the seeds of the apple
Bearing the tree of the apple
Trapped in the weeds like a scarecrow
Stuck to the wind like Velcro
Distantly hearing the bell toll
Warbling chime through the meadow

Mama, the scream of the eagle
Threading my heart through the needle
Threading the blood through the apple
Eve sucked the juice from the apple
Nakedly running, I saw her
Boy chasing after to stall her
I wish I'd have spoken to call her
Before she found fabric to shawl her
Breasts bound and burdened with fiber
Adam came trembling beside her
And he said, and he said
That she has the poison inside her
She talks to snakes and they guide her
She has the poison inside her
She talks to snakes and they guide her
She has the poison inside her
She talks to snakes and they guide her
She has the poison inside her
She talks to snakes and they guide 

[Trackname: Little Things]

The little things I like about you
How you say when you say what you do
When your feeling is a little gold and blue
When your feeling is a little strung out
Everything we talk about
Living in the city is a crowded place
I still lose sight of every other face

Turn in your direction
Feeling like I need attention
I told you this once or twice
Won't you hear?
I see you in the yard drinking a beer
Leaving me undressed
Like some cheap classic movie
Maybe I'm a little obsessed
Maybe you do use me

One step behind you
Following you down
I was inside of you
Kissing your mouth
You were inside of me
Kissing my mouth
Seeing out that needle eye
Seeing out that needle eye
Seeing out that needle eye

The little things I like about you
How you say when you say what you do
When your feeling is a little gold and blue
When your feeling is a little strung out
Everything we talk about
New York City is a crowded place
I still lose sight of every other face

One step behind you
Following you down
I was inside of you
Where are you now?
Where are you now? (Ah)

Ah, oh
The things I love
The things, the things I like
Will you stay?
Will you feel?
You'll feel
Oh-oh, 

[Trackname: Heavy Bend]

Yeah

Came to light on a very hot day
The grass was sweating
You were sleeping in
With the window open
The blanket breathing
Cigarette on a golden ashtray
Your golden hair lay
In the swollen sunray
The withered roses hanging in the doorway

Don't wanna be right
Don't wanna be let down
Don't wanna fight
Don't wanna pretend
Formless secret
Heavy bend
Heavy bend

Second sight and the clouds above you
As the wilderness grew thickеr and the crow flew
Tossing and turning, your forehеad burning
Don't wanna be right
Don't wanna be let down
Don't wanna fight
Don't wanna defend
Formless secret
Heavy bend
From the empty height
Flies on the ceiling now
I wanna hold you tight
Don't wanna pretend
Formless secret
Heavy bend
Heavy bend
Heavy 

[Trackname: Flower of Blood]

Give me some time on Earth to know you
Help me unearth the map and show you
Thinking of her, thinking of him, want to?

When you touch me

Mirror in the sky making me cry again
Roll up the sheets, suddenly frozen
Like a knife carving through my thick skin

When you touch me
When you touch me

Hearing you sigh soft and heavy
Holding mine 'til you feel ready
Flower of blood bloom on my tongue, steady

When you touch me
When you touch me
Flower of blood
Flower of blood bloom on my tongue

When you find the lonely tower
Climb inside the darkеst room
Feel afraid, surrender your power

Whеn you touch me
When you touch me
When you touch me

Feel afraid, surrender your power

[Trackname: Blurred View]

I am the magazine, the blue screen
The big hand moving past the last thing
I turn for you, turn for you
Turn for you, turn for you

I am the private room, the quiet croon
The grey eye blinking on the new moon
I burn for you, burn for you
Burn for you, burn for you

Within the last kiss, I am the genesis
While the earth rolls, bleeding from its axis
Return to you, turn to you
Turn to you, turn to you

I am the water rise, the waterfall
Filling up your eyes and when you give the call
I run for you, run for you
Run for you, run for you
Run for you, run for you
Run for you
I am the sweaty sheets, the wet bed
The things she'll do and the things she said
I'll come for you, come for you
Come for you, come for you

I am the right brain, the paper crane
The bright gold moving past the night train
A blurred view, blurred view
Blurred view, blurred view

I am the new disease
I am the new disease, the light breeze
The yellow stars glowing through the white trees
I pine for you, pine for you
Shine for you, pine for you

I am the teeth sharp, the lips read
What is unfeared and what is unfed
I'll feed for you, feed for you
Feed for you, feed for you

One step closer and I'm real
Tell me everything you feel
And I will sing for you, sing for you
Sing for you, sing for you
Sing for you
One step closer and I'm real
Tell me everything you feel
One step closer and I'm real
Tell me everything you feel
And I will sing for you, sing for you
Sing for you, sing for you
Sing for you

[Trackname: Red Moon]

Red moon rising like a fire in me
So many questions, she asks them all to me
I have to answer most curiously
Scarlet angel, I am too small to see
Earn, earn, shuffle 'round the big city
Burning the rubber down, crossing the hot concrete
I'm gonna leave town, there is someone to meet
She turns her head around a full three-sixty
Woo

Bedroom rising from an old growth tree
Bringing out the sawmill, cutting the twelve-inch beams
Building a pattern, the reservoir to fill with dreams
Rings like Saturn telling their old story
Windmills turn and turn eternally
What do you yearn for? Where do you long to be?
I've been here before, looking at the wild country
Open the screen door, talking with Diane Lee
That's my grandma

Radio singing from the corner of the kitchen
I got the oven on, I got the onions wishing
They hadn't made me cry, filling the sink with dishes
Letting them air dry, waiting for the wind's permission
Too many movies got me shivering and shy
Turning the lights out, glistening in the owl's eye
Glimmer like lightning under the violet sky
Shimmer like diamonds, watching the red moon rise


[Trackname: Dried Roses]
Leave the bed unmade
Draw the light green shade
Start the microwave
Dried roses
Cradle, yeah, she does
Lights the fire because
Window frost
Heat loss
Dried roses
Steep the black coffee
Set the plates, pour the tea
Three for her, three for me
Dried roses
Sleepily, she walks
Gradually, she talks
With the geese, she flocks
Dried roses
Afternoon, midnight
Morning's what she likes
Fly thе broom, see the moon
Dried roses
Hеre I go, there I am
All alone in the pan
In the silence again
Dried roses
Half-dead, half-awake
Make a pie, bake a cake
Which road will you take?
Dried roses
Goodness her, goodness me
Goodness eternity
Out you go, in you be
Dried roses
So leave the bed unmade
Draw the light green shade
Start the microwave
Dried roses
Dried roses

[Trackname: No Reason]

Been pulling through
Since the last time I touched you
Making due with an internet signal
Calling for the delivery to the front door

There is no reason to believe
No reason at all
Come together for a moment, look around and dissolve
Like a feeling, like a flash
Like a fallen eyelash
On your sweater, threading future through the past

City of salt bone and bell tower
Country of ice rain and wildflower
Picking out the wreath for the funеral and
There is no reason to bеlieve
No reason at all
Come together for a moment, look around and dissolve
Like a feeling, like a flash
Like a fallen eyelash
On your sweater, threading future through the past

There is no reason to believe
No reason at all
Come together for a moment, look around and dissolve
Like a feeling, like a flash
Like a fallen eyelash
On your sweater, threading future through the past

There is no reason to believe
Come together
Like a feeling, like a flash

[Trackname: Wake Me up to Drive]

Exit on a whim
Hopefully, we find it again
I'm tired of turning back
Let's keep on moving down the track
And if the horse lies down
There's a push just a mile uptown
If the horse lies down

Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride

Hand upon my skin
Warm me up and calm me down
I like to watch your chin
Tracing the familiar sound
Of a famous song
Put one on, let's sing along
To the famous song

Wake mе up to drive, wake me up to drivе
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride
Vacancies, none
The same ideas from everyone
We never plan ahead
We take the gamble on instead
And if they turn us down
Find a warm bed in the next town
If they turn us down

Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride

[Trackname: Promise Is a Pendulum]

I could never build the ether or the grass overgrown
I could never build the river with a mouth full of foam
I could never build the winter with her cold tears of glitter
I've been listening to the red oak and the acorn she cries
Been listening to the white birch and the paper she dries
I've been listening to the frogs joke, listening to the fire smoke

I can never tеll you now what I had often said before
Bеcause promise is a pendulum just swinging at the door
And I'm not saying I'm not jealous or scared anymore
I'm just saying

I could never build a rainbow or any kind of flower
I could never make a sparrow or a meteor shower
I could never build an earthworm, never make the earth turn
I've been listening to the laughing of the fox down the trail
I've been clasping to the listening of the moss to the snail
Ooh
The shimmer of the beech leaves as the wind does a big sneeze

I could never tell you now what I had often said before
Because promise is a pendulum just swinging at the door
And I'm not saying I'm not jealous or scared anymore
I'm just saying
I could never build the shadow between your cheek and your eye
I could never make a freckle or the warm breath you sigh
The canopy of lashes with the softness of ashes
I've been listening to the memory, the way that it was
Listening to the echo of whys and because
Listening to the echo telling me to let go

I could never tell you now what I had often said before
Because promise is a pendulum just hanging at the door
And I'm not saying I'm not jealous or scared anymore
I'm just saying
Saying

[Trackname: 12,000 Lines]

Crossed twelve-thousand lines looking for your face
Only to find not a trace
Even the memory of your mouth tries to disappear
Little lights turn into spheres
Blue mountain in the rearview

Some nights, barely breathing at all
Waiting for my woman to call

Cross twelve letters down, found the longest word
This morning, I'd heard
Somebody said they saw you 'round 1st and 23rd
Blue feathers in your hairdo

Some nights, barely breathing at all
Waiting for my woman to call
Maple cherry leaves start to fall
Waiting for my woman to call

Sweet honey, stirring in my tea
You'rе stirring me
Forgiveness, all thе money in the world
Won't buy it
Some nights, barely breathing at all
Waiting for my woman to call

[Trackname: Simulation Swarm]

I tried to tell you
I didn't know how to stay
You believe she can see through
Cutting at the silent clay
A relief, beckon deep blue
Fettered in the magnet sun
Eat the gun as it feeds you
Spitting up the oxygen
Once again
Once again

Once again, empty horses
Gallop through the violet door
Follow red, crooked courses
Shadows on the moonlit floor
Oh, my stars, winged creatures
Gathering in silken height
Like the last human teachers

Once again, wе must bleed new
Even as the hours shakе
Crystal blood like a dream true
A ripple in the wound and wake
You believe, I believe too
That you are the river of light
Who I love, that I cling to
In the belly of the empty night
From the thirty-first floor of the simulation swarm
With the drone of fluorescence
Flicker, fever, fill the form
With a warm gush, now I wanna touch
Like we never could before
I'd fly to you tomorrow, I'm not fighting in this war
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms
And walk you to the shore

I remember building an energy shield
In your room, like a temple
Swallows in the windless field
Very thin, with your mother
Tall as a pale green tree
Very wild, bright as winter
Rising with a prism key
And a child to deliver
Taken with the blood and vine
As the first little angel

Little Andy, soft in your newborn skin
Only one, little Andy, will you return again?
I believe we can renew
And you could be my brother
Once again, fall asleep with our backs against each other
You believe, I believe too
That you are the river of light who I love
That I sing to in the belly of the empty night
From the thirty-first floor of the simulation swarm
With the drone of fluorescence
Flicker, fever, fill the form
With a warm gush, now I wanna touch
Like we never could before
I'd fly to you tomorrow, I'm not fighting in this war
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms
And walk you to the shore
I'd fly to you tomorrow, I'm not fighting in this war
I wanna drop my arms and take your 

[Trackname: Love Love Love]

-ight is l-

I already died
I'm singing from the other side
Underneath love
Avoidance and pride
I look you in the face and lie
I tell you I want your love
You're the cigarette in my fist
You are so hard to resist
I can't help but breathe your love
When I'm scared to die alone
That's when I call you on the phone
I tell you that I need your love

Oh, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love

Oh, frailty and fragile words
You tell me a lot of words
You tell me all about your love
And I feel what I hear you say
I don't talk the same way
'Cause that don't feel like love
As the dog opens his eyes
As the blue crow flies
I'm going to meet my love
I already died
I'm calling from the other side
Underneath love
There's a bottle out in the sea
With a message inside from me
Saying, "Release my love"
Release my love, my love
I'm dreaming of release, my love
Release my love, my love
Release my love
Release my love


It's a moving operation
I'm getting off at this station
I'm leaving your love
I'm scared to die alone
I call you on the phone
Watch me bleed your love

Oh, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Release my love, my love
Release my love, my love
Release my love
Release my love, my love
Release my love, my love
Release my love

[Trackname: The Only Place]

What if all the worlds in space
Would melt into one single place
And intertwine the human race
With other kinds?
The atom is an empty vase
A vehicle to know embrace
The way you feel, the way you taste
It multiplies

So much to share
So much to share

When all material scatters
And ashes amplify
The only place that matters
Is by your side

What if all the time between
The words we say and what we mean
Would roll as softly as a stream
That we could ride?
We'd ride the bend from source to mouth
I want a friend from north to south
To build that question as a house
Where we'd reside
So much to share
So much to share

When all material scatters
And ashes amplify
The only place that matters
Is by your side


When all material scatters
And ashes amplify
The only place that matters
Is by your side

[Trackname: Blue Lightning]

One
One, two, one, two

Blue lightning was an autograph signing up the sky
To the question that I had to ask, she only answered, "Why?"
Angelia took the photograph, the moment had to die
Years later, like an epitaph, we read it and we cry
This morning, I went to have a bath, the water ran dry
Clear warning, has it come at last, the time to say goodbye?
Can we make love? Can we hold fast? I really wanna try

Two-eyed lie, is it fight or fly?
I wanna be the shoelace that you tie
'Til the end, will you be my friend?
I wanna be the wrinkle in your eye
Yeah, I wanna be the vapor gets you high

Blue heron, now you're scaring me, you circle and dive
Blue angel, yeah, you're in my dreams, swearing every night
And a spider just beside her, larger than a hill
And it's plain to see if she don't comfort me, the rattlesnake will
Two-eyed lie, is it fight or fly?
I wanna be the wrinkle in your eye
'Til the end, will you be my friend?
I wanna be the shoelace that you tie
Yeah, I wanna be the vapor gets you high

Two-eyed lie, is it fight or fly?
I wanna be the shoelace that you tie
'Til the end, will you be my friend?
I wanna be the mountain, kiss the sky
Yeah, I wanna be the vapor gets you high
Yeah, I wanna feel so happy that I cry
Yeah, I wanna be the shoelace that you tie
Yeah, I wanna live forever 'til I die
Yeah, I wanna live forever 'til I die
Yeah, I

Hmm
Gorgeous set, okay, what should we do now?
