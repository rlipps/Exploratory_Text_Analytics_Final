[Trackname: It's Working]

Here, you focus
So I can see your faces
The eyes are wrong
How will I know if it's working right?

Light confuses
The tiny isles of bruises
The mangled lines
I see the signs of aging

But if I try to feel at all
I am deceived, my mind's affected
It's empty now, as I lay down
I feel alright, my heart is racing

Turn the noise on (The noise on)
I'd like to feed my poison (My poison)
Assembly lines
Carry a velvet warning
To the yard
It's just like striking matches
The polish lies
But it's working in your blood (Working in your blood)
Which you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind (It's working in your mind)
And not your heart

No, it's working

It's working in your blood (Working in your blood)
Which you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind (It's working in your mind)
Not your heart
It's working in your blood (Working in your blood)
Yet, you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind (It's working in your mind)
Not your heart
It's working in your blood (Working in your blood)
Which you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind (It's working in your mind)
Not your heart
It's working in your blood (Working in your blood)
Which you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind (It's working in your mind)
Not your 

[Trackname: Song for Dan Treacy]

He spends his time
Or maybe half of his time
Or part of the time wandering
Around the creeks and cobble stones of Hackney lanes
With a tear in his eye
As the children walk by, he's thinking of a song
And then stops to paint a picture of a frown
Walking around

Dan Treacy's smile
Leaves you trying to decide
Who's the victim, what's the crime?
No rest for the mind that's seen it all before
And I don't know where he lives
But he's a myth of a man and Texas Bob the cameraman
Is off to fix his suit before the show
Yeah, but where did he go?

To know when your time's up
You flip the glass and watch the hours quickening
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the back of the station
Fluorescent lights about to quit their flickering
Well, he speaks his mind, he says, "What is crime?"
Dan Treacy's eyes
In the middle of the park
When the underground is dark
He's a poet, he's a lark
He starts thinking about a place that no one knows
And when the creeks run dry
He stays frozen in time
Strange lights in the sky start blinking
I can see the car outside but he's listening, ooh
He's listening, ooh
He's listening, ah
And he's making up his mind

(He made his mind up) To get things done and overcome
(He made his mind up) Yeah, he's gonna let it go
(He made his mind up) In the park and at the station
(He made his mind up) Yeah, he's gonna get it done
(He made his mind up) Ooh yeah, he's gonna get it done
(He made his mind up)

Yeah, he's gonna let it go, ooh-ooh
No matter the time, oh, oh
When the creeps run by, oh no
He's making his mind up, oh, oh, oh, oh
Said, yeah, he's gonna get it done, whoa-oh
Oh yeah, when the creeks run dry, whoa-oh
Say, yeah, he's gonna listen to his soul
Say, yeah, when the creeps walk by
"Come here boy, look me in the eye"
Bow to the heart, back to the beat of Dan 

[Trackname: Someone's Missing]

Someone's telling the toll to me
I'm cut and weeping like a rubber tree
But I don't care who's left behind
Lost revelations that I'll never find

In the long hall, pipes are whispering
Blues prepared for anti-christening

Somewhere there's an honest soul
To mirror teeth where neon lures troll
And what's extinct might come alive
A purple smoke in some internal shrine

With a long sigh let the hissing in
Stones deformed by gentle kissing and
All the closed eyes start to glisten
But it feels like someone's missing
It feels like someone's missing
Yeah, it feels like someone's missing
It feels like someone's missing

Feels like someone's missing
Yeah, it feels like someone's missing
It feels like someone's missing
It feels like someone's missing
Feels like someone's missing
Yeah, it feels like someone's missing
It feels like someone's missing
Yeah, it feels like someone's 

[Trackname: Flash Delirium]

Mild apprehension
Blank dreams of the coming fun
Distort the odds of a turnaround
Gut screams out next to none
So turn it on, tune it in, and stay inert

You say, "I've got the backbone"
The back way to escape the gun
Climbing a tree with a missing limb
And not saving anyone
And now it hurts to stay at home and see flash

The mirror ball's throwing mold
And you can't get a grip if there's nothing to hold
You see the flash catch a white lily laugh and wilt
And if you must smash a glass first fill it to the hilt

Plants, as far as I know, are still
Still bending towards the light
And if we dance until the heart explodes
It will make this place ignite
And even if this hall collapses
I can stand by my pillar of hope
It's just a case of flash delirium
Here's a growing culture deep inside a corpse
Ages stuck together, takin' it to the source
Timeless desperation, pictures on a screen scream
"Hey, people, what does it mean?"

Comfort keeps us nice
So quick to donate everything (nothing arrives)
Die wolken drifting blinding smiles circling (einkreisen)
And time's tingling spines
Attaching hands to floor
The rosy-tinted flash

The hot dog's getting cold
And you'll never be as good as the Rolling Stones
Watch the birds in the airport gathering dirt
Crowd the clean magazine chick lifting up her skirt

Lines when I close my eyes and just (Why close one eye and try to)
Aim blindly at the sun (Pledge allegiance to the sun)
And hear love when the ghosts start singing
(When plastic ghosts start terrorizing everyone)
Terrorizing everyone
And geometric troops aligning
Carried up to the burial mounds with gold
It's a heavy time but your (My earthbound heart is heavy)
Your rhythm makes it light (Your heartbeat keeps things light)
And explode like a violent star keeps (With the violence forever)
Threatening the night
And even if this hall collapses
I can stand by my pillar of hope and trust
That our heads won't bust
red battleships
Forty earthlike planets
Three holes, two tits
One fork in its side
Zero tears in their eyes

Sue the spiders, sink the Welsh, stab your Facebook, sell, sell, sell
Undercooked, overdone, mass adulation not so funny
Poisoned honey, pseudo-science, silly money, you're my honey!

[Trackname: I Found a Whistle]

Hey, I found a whistle that hangs like a charm
And when my noose is tied I could blow it
And fall down into your arms
Fifteen centuries of dissolution and grief
To return a yellow trickster and a thief

Hey, I found a whistle that works every time
That's when the trail escapes to nowhere
And the flood erases the crime
Such conviction, to paint all the walls with the blood
Of the young and the faithful and the good

Yeah, I found a whistle as thin as a sheet
To split the dumbness of a vision
Between a sleep and asleep
Tiny axes repeatedly raising the flag
All ignored, real emotion's such a drag

Hey, I've got a pistol that's aimed at your heart
And on dark nights when the moon is right, I could show you
The head attached with a scarf
Aerophane sorceress, at home obeying the fates
When it's gone, has it gone all the way?
This time, found a whistle that works every time
Yeah, I, I found a whistle that works
Hangs like a charm 'round my neck
Found a whistle that works every time
Yeah, I found a whistle that works
Closes my mind every time
A whistle, I've got it, I've got it this time


[Trackname: Siberian Breaks]


Sleep as the goer
The bridge that watches the light speed through
And cries while the spirit stumbles
The inside missile for the protection of you

Maybe it's silent
The voice can't bear any more strain
But speaks without even knowing
And streams outside in the direction of truth

There's no reason there's no secrets to decode
If you can't save it, leave it dying on the road
Wide open arms can feel so cold
So cold, feel so cold

Balance the books, the ledges, the looms
The disappointed look on the faces that squint at the moon
Let's see it with shadows enhanced
And then vote to decide who'll advance
Silver jet plane making a turn
Exciting the brain that expects it to crash and then burn
It's not the life lesson I'd've guessed
If you're conscious you must be depressed
Or at least cynical
But someone might still eat the steaks
Even if they're tough
Spending the day, chewing at the fat
Floating away isn't rough but it's not enough

Oh Marianne, pass me the joint
The sandpaper's tan, go-getters are surfing the point
And London's a scratch on the lens
It's over before it begins
Silk 'round her neck falls down to her shoulders
The older I get, the more I suspect there's a trick
But really there's no trip at all
That doesn't result in a fall
Or a faltering

But something could spit out the bait
Even if it's real
Rolling away, missing a spoke
Close to the ground like a wheel, but it's not a joke
Holding the line, clutching the phone
Nobly wasting the night, but it isn't right
It's not right
Smelling for blood, praying for rain
Running away isn't rough, but it's not enough

The low tide is telling me when it's over
To breathe in everything exposed
And comes back to cover me with a blanket
Being here's always changing tunes


The empty sky surrounds me but I can't see at all
Wide-open arms can feel so cold
And you can sit beside me and tell me what it's worth
But I hope I die before I get sold
I hope I die before I get sold
I'd rather die before I get sold

If you find the soul that you lost
Frozen in a starry void
Take it within and hope the sight of blood
Can will signs of life to return
Back to the way that it was
Long before it made a noise
To keep on quietly reminding you
What's never created or destroyed

Wake as the swell peaks
The close-outs drowning the birds with roars
And howls scare the new unkindness
That picks and laughs at the carrion scene

Forces you see breathe can always go into hiding
And wait 'til it passes over
Or stay far gone for all eternity


[Trackname: Brian Eno]

So tired, soul searching
I followed sounds to a cathedral
Imagine my surprise to find
That they were produced by Brian Eno

Past the gates, quite stark
The roses trimmed and the windows dark
I see the walls through a limestone crack
Not red not blue not yellow but black
And all the spaces left for you
If the sky was synthesized, you'd probably know

He taught me many things
The wisdom of oblique stratagems
The prophet of a sapphire soul
Presented through creative freedoms
And everything I say is true
Because if I was telling lies, it'd probably show

I can tell when he's kind of smiling
But what does he know? (What does he know?)
We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
When I was stuck he'd make me memorize elaborate curses
Tinctures and formulas to ditch the chori and flip the verses
My whole foundation came unglued
When I tried to humanize by ambient light

Dipping swords in metaphors, yeah, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
Brian Eno (Brian Eno)

He promised pretty worlds and all the silence I could dream of
Brian Peter George St. John Le Baptiste de la Salle Eno

Well, all alone by the oldest stone where the shade trees grow
(What does he know?)
The creature by the water feature with the ghostly glow
(Brian Eno)
Making sure that time's preserved well, we reap what we sow
(What does he know?)
We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
Yeah, I can tell that he's doing well, yeah, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
I'm always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno
(Brian Eno)
Yeah, he dips swords in metaphors yeah, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
I'd like to see him plant a forest, because I don't know
Brian Eno
I can tell that he's trying to smile, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
I'll always be a step behind him, Brian Eno
(Brian Eno) Yeah
He's making sure that time's preserved well, we reap what we sow
(What does he know?)
I'm always one step behind him, because I don't know
What Brian Enos


[Trackname: Congratulations]

Dead in the water, it's not a paid vacation
The sons and daughters of city officials attend demonstrations
It's hardly a sink or swim when all is well if the ticket sells

Out with a whimper, it's not a blaze of glory
You look down from your temple as people endeavor to make it a story
And chisel a marble word, but all is lost if it's never heard

But I've got someone to make reports that tell me how my money's spent
To book my stays and draw my blinds so I can't tell what's really there
And all I need's a great big congratulations

I'll keep your dreams, you pay attention for me
As strange as it seems, I'd rather dissolve than have you ignore me
The ground may be moving fast but I tied my boots to a broken mast

The difference is clear, you throw it in your cauldron
Rust and veneer, dusk and dawn, Steinways and Baldwins
You start with a simple stock of all the waste and salt to taste

But damn my﻿ luck and damn these friends that keep on combing back their smiles
I save my grace with half-assed guilt and lay down the quilt upon the lawn
Spread my arms and soak up
