[Trackname: Keep Your Name]

I don't know why you abandoned me
You were my soul and my partner
What we imagined and what we became
We'll keep 'em separate and you keep your name

You keep your name
You keep your name
You keep your name
You keep your name, you keep your name

There is a place that we both know
It lives in our hearts, we built it together
Fear is a manacle but love is unchained
So we'll keep 'em separate and you keep your name

You keep your name (We don't see eye to eye)
You keep your name (We don't see eye to eye)
You keep your name (We don't see eye to eye)
You keep your name (We don't see eye to eye)

I wasn't there for you
I didn't pay attention
I didn't take you seriously
And I didn't listen
I don't think I ever loved you
That was some stupid shit
I wanted what you wanted but we never really felt the same
I kept my name 'cause we were just different
Your heart is saying clothing line
My body said Naomi Klein, No Logo
We shared kisses and visions
But like KISS' shithead Gene Simmons said:
A band is a brand and it licks that our vision is dissonant
You always hurried to grow up
I think I'll always just feel kinda the same
(But you say) What I want from art is truth, what you want is fame
Now we'll keep 'em separate and you keep your name

You keep your name (We don't see eye to eye)
You keep your name (We don't see eye to eye)
You keep your name (We don't see eye to eye)
You keep your name (We don't see eye to eye

[Trackname: Death Spiral]

Hold up, I was reborn the second before the
Plane became shards of glass
And ash when it crashed on arrival I woke up
Feeling like I'm sipping on some Ren√© Descartes
And you're Big Gulping the Bible
Your wings are broken so we fly in a spiral
All I have is my love of love
But now you wanna blow us up
You're so rock 'n' roll suicidal

Tailspin, nose down
Now it's a race to the bottom
Tailspin, nose down
Now it's a race to the bottom

(You spin me around)
In a wild death spiral
(We're hitting the ground)
In a fiery pile
(Whose fault I couldn't fly)
For the dials, only by the eye
(Now the ring is on fire)
Now it's final
Death spiral
What can we say? It's too late
We can't rewind to when we were both open and amazed
Like a wide-eyed child's smile
But it's the end, we're enemies, not friends
I don't know your state of mind, mine's good, bye

Tailspin, nose down
Now it's a race to the bottom
Tailspin, nose down
Now it's a race to the bottom

(You spin me around)
In a wild death spiral
(We're hitting the ground)
In a fiery pile
(Whose fault I couldn't fly)
For the dials, only by the eye
(Now the ring is on fire)
Now it's final
Death spiral

Our love is in a spiral (Death)
Our love is a (Death), my love is a (Death)
Our love is in a spiral (Death spiral)
Our love is a (Death), my love is a (Death)
Our love is in a spiral (Death spiral)
Spiral
(Death spiral)
Spiral
This isn't 'bout the time you chased me down the street
Face a rictus of misery and pain
You grabbed my arm and wouldn't let me leave
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!
Or how I never learned to let you breathe
Condescended relentlessly
These threads need disentangling
So we have thread left to weave
Now our love is spiraling finally down
Now our helix is widening, coming unbound

(You spin me around)
In a wild death spiral
(We're hitting the ground)
In a fiery pile
(Whose fault I couldn't fly)
For the dials, only by the eye
(Now the ring is on fire)
Now it's final
Death spiral

Our love is in a spiral (Death)
Your love is a (Death), my love is a (Death)
Our love is in a spiral (Death spiral)
Your love is a (Death), my love is a (Death)
Our love is in a spiral (Death spiral)
Your love is a (Death), my love is a (Death)
Our love is in a spiral (Death spiral)
Spiral
(Death spiral)

[Trackname: Up In Hudson]

I thought the sun rose in your eyes
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
I thought the sun rose in
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
I thought the sun rose in your eyes

The first time ever I saw your face, laid my eyes on you
Was the Bowery Ballroom stage, you were shredding Marshall tubes
And I knew that I had to get to know
You, why don't you pack your clothes?
Move to Brooklyn on your own
And join the band, come on the road

We talked for like two minutes
But I had a feeling
Something awkward but new between us
Something strong and appealing

And we both had girl- and boyfriends blowing us up SMS
But we both knew a mood like this so strong would be wrong to suppress
Felt like it bore the impress of destiny
In a minivan in New England, our eyes met
We said yes and we said yes
Love will burn out
Love will just fade away

First time I ever kissed your mouth, we both felt time stop
My heart, it leapt up, wow, jumped from a mountaintop
Then I knew: maybe I could be with you
Do the things that lovers do
Slightly domesticate the truth
And write you "Stillness Is the Move"

The ceilings that we ignored
The slept-on floors never ending
Our feeling obscured but pure
And our love ascending

This is how we saw the world, side by side from the road and the stage
So our lives were twined and curled and mixed up like the code we obeyed
And that was basically my dream and I dreamed it with you 'til we betrayed it

And love will burn out
And love will just fade away
And love's gonna rot
And love will just dissipate
Now we're going our separate ways
But we're still connected
You'll go forward and I'll stay the same
And that's how it breaks

Wash it away, wash it away
All of the pain, all of the pain and anger
It slips away, love slips away
But it will remain, it will remain unanswered

Now I'm listening to Kanye on the Taconic Parkway, riding fast
And you're out in Echo Park, blasting 2Pac, drinking a fifth for my ass
I'm just up in Hudson bored and destructive knowing that nothing lasts

'Cause love will burn out
And love will just fade away
Yeah love's gonna rot
And love will just dissipate
'Cause love will burn out
And love will just fade away
And love's gonna rot
And love will just 

[Trackname: Work Together]

Complex plans and high ideals
But he treats people poorly
Is a ceaseless ambitiousness proxy for a void
He's ignoring

How good
We could have it if we work together
I feel love should be enough to get it easily done
Maybe love is competition that makes us raise the bar
We better ourselves
We could be so good if we work together

Work together, work together, work together
Work together, work together, work together

Crippling fear, assailing doubt
So she blinkers her vision
Is the life she's living not the one she dreamt of and envisioned?

How good
We could have it if we work together
I feel love should be enough to get it easily done
Maybe love is competition that makes us raise the bar
We better ourselves
I'm just here for the reciprocity to drop
Now we gon' see
Work together, work together, work together
Work together, work together, work together
Work together, work together, work together
Work together, work together, work together

How good
We could have it if we work together
I feel love should be enough to get it easily done
Maybe love is competition that makes us raise the bar and better ourselves
We could be so good if we work together

Work together, work together, work together, work together

You made me feel like maybe love
Maybe love is competition
You made me feel like maybe love
Maybe love is competition
You made me feel like maybe love
Maybe love is competition
You made me feel like maybe love
Maybe love is competition

[Trackname: Little Bubble]

Morning
About the break of day
Here we lay, arm in arm
And cradled by the dawn

Morning
Rays of light like champagne
Filter through and fill our room
We wake with no alarm

How did you sleep?
What did you dream of?
Can you still remember?
Was it the key of love?
The line of light that we both know?
Or a shadow descending from above?

We had our own little bubble
For a while
We had our own little bubble
For a while
We didn't know one way or other
For a while
We had our own little bubble
For a while
Morning
There's no one else here
I'm alone and the cold October light hits like a black hole
Growling gray pit
Sentry of emptiness

It's not enough, whatever I dreamed of
Dreams are dumb and meaningless
Like the days they refract
Blurred and dull, empty and sad
I want to sleep with no dreams
I want to be dead

We had our own little bubble
For a while
We had our own little bubble
For a while
We didn't know one way or other
For a while
We had our own little bubble
For a while

[Trackname: Winner Take Nothing]
I'm living at the Ace
You're sleeping late in our apartment
It's just been 808s for the eight days since our restart went heartbreak
I am afraid, I've been all in on works and not grace
Thought we'd invest and save
But it's all rigged, a gamble and a waste
Winner take nothing
Fighting we can only lose
Winner take nothing
Killing me and killing you
'Cause you and me are the same
Now I'm shining like tears in the rain
And you're shining like fifteen of fame, babe
But our diamonds blooded
Nickel dull and so opaque
No trophy, no cake
Winner take nothing
I want it all and I want it more
Baby, I wanted our dream
And when you're no longer asleep
We'll go to Five Leaves
I built my life around our love to ground your dreamworld
I held so tight
But I never could give you enough
Winner take nothing
Fighting we can only lose
Winner take nothing
Killing me and killing you
'Cause you and me are the same
Now I'm shining like tears in the rain
And you're shining like fifteen of fame, babe
But our diamonds blooded
Nickel dull and so opaque
No trophy, no cake
Winner take nothing
Winner take
Nothing
Winner take
Nothing
Winner take
We spent all those years in McCarren
Watching the green leaves turn brown again
We walked on Manhattan Ave. while the Dollar Tree turned New American
And as much as I'd like to say we both won
As much as I'd like to say I'm grateful for the experience
That we've grown together and bettered each other
And built the city with one another
The truth is you'd sell out the waterfront for condos and malls
I'd throw the dice with the rest of 'em
Down on Broad Street and Wall
This has turned me against myself
In losing you, I lost myself
That's the why the winner takes nothing else
Winner take nothing
Fighting we can only lose
Winner take nothing
Killing me and killing you
'Cause you and me are the same
Now I'm shining like tears in the rain
And you're shining like fifteen of fame, babe
But our diamonds blooded
Nickel dull and so opaque
No trophy, no cake
Winner take
Nothing
Fighting we can only lose
Winner take
Nothing
Winner take
Nothing
Killing me and killing you
Winner take
Nothing
Winner take
Nothing
Now I'm shining like tears in the rain
Winner take
Nothing
And you're shining like fifteen of fame, babe
Winner take
Nothing
Nickel dull and so opaque
Winner take
Nothing
Winner take nothing

[Trackname: Ascent Through Clouds]

You're alone
Even though you're the same
As everyone
With your ketchup blood and your changeable flame
I go out for a walk
Back way through the fog to the moon with who I talk
I am so myself, I am no one else
You are one who helped me and took my help
I fly fluid and remade
Ascending through the clouds and joining the constellation
There was never more than now
Urge and urge again, newly took and new endowed
I am not contained
In my chest or in my brain
I am energy unconstrained
And even though I want to
I find it hard to stay
In constant contact
Sometimes I go away
Sometimes I go away
Solitude becomes alienation
And leads you to togetherness
Pleasure slides into pain
And into pleasure again
Forgiveness, need, apology
Redemption and surrendering
Strangers become friends
And then strangers again
I become you and you become me
Suddenly we are not who we were
Passion and intellect combine
In human love:
Highest common denomination
The feeling of weariness
The slide in between pain and bliss
The surrender to forgiveness
The happy acceptance of a kiss
Inevitability
Of sadness
The river washing us away
Washing the garbage too and trash
Love and gratitude for the
Opportunity
One more chance maybe
To see the sun raise

Even though I want to
I find it hard to stay in constant contact
I gotta go my own 

[Trackname: Cool Your Heart]

How do you feel?
Is it loneliness?
Is there shining in your heart
But no gloss on your lips?
Do you sail alone 'round the island with
A silhouette of a shark beneath the skiff
And then you say

Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one, the right one

You've been waiting for the love in me
And there's been waters indeed
We've been hanging tight for all the things we want out of love
So wade, go deep on these mellow waters too

Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one, the right one
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one, the right one

Though I been trying hard not to fall
The feeling is tumbling in
Last night, I realized it's been feeling wrong
To start relying, making decisions based on another person

Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one, the right one
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one, the right one
Cool your heart
Cool your heart

[Trackname: I See You]

Heaven knows we've been to hell
Heavy, hard, and far -- how we fell
And we overwhelmed ourselves with fighting and yelling
Losing and finding dreams we've held
But now the spell is shattered
And now we are on earth
Forgiveness, reconciliation
Gratitude, you know me and I know you
(This) This is the way
(That) We will change
(Time) The ocean wave
(The pain) We will embrace
And what held us together
Is what tears us apart
So I'll let go of the tether
And you let go my heart (you let go my heart)
And it's gonna get better (you let go my heart)
And we could just be in kindness and peace now seeing that the love is the art
Yeah, I believe that the love that we made is the art
And now it is gettin' late
It's time to say the projection is fading away
And in its place I see you
I see you
I see you
I see you
We won't be afraid to grow
We won't be afraid to grow
What we gave, we will always retain
I remember and I will remain
Proud and glad you were in my life
Forgiveness, reconciliation
Gratitude, you know me and I know you
Time passes away
There'll be other lovers
Forward and into a
Future imagined by neither of us
And what held us together
Is what tears us apart
So I'll let go of the tether
And you let go my heart (you let go my heart)
It's gonna get better (you let go my heart)
And we could just be in kindness and peace now seeing that the love is the art
Yeah, I believe that the love we made is the art
Yeah, I believe that the love we made is the art
And now it is getting late, it's time to say
The projection is fading away
And in its place
And now it is getting late, it's time to say
The projection is fading away
And in its place
And now it is getting late, it's time to say
The projection is fading away
And in its place I see you
I see you
I see you
And in its place I see you
I see you
I see you
I can see
