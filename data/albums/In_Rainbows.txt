[Trackname: 15 Step]

How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out, then you cut the string
How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
First you reel me out and then you cut the string

You used to be alright
What happened?
Did the cat get your tongue?
Did your string come undone?
One by one
One by one
It comes to us all
It's as soft as your pillow

You used to be alright
What happened?
Et cetera, et cetera
Fads for whatever
Fifteen steps, then a sheer drop
How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out, then you cut the 

[Trackname: Bodysnatchers]

I do not
Understand
What it is
I've done wrong
Full of holes
Check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes
Two for no

I have no idea what I am talking about
I am trapped in this body and can't get out

You killed the sound
Removed backbone
A pale imitation
With the edges sawn off

I have no idea what you are talking about
Your mouth moves only with someone's hand up your arse

Has the light gone out for you?
Because the light's gone out for me
It is the twenty-first century
It is the twenty-first century
It can follow you like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got a skin and they put me in
They got a skin and they put me in
On the lines wrapped 'round my face
On the lines wrapped 'round my face
And for anyone else to see
And for anyone else to see
I'm a lie
I've seen it coming
They've seen it coming
They've seen it coming
They've seen it 

[Trackname: Nude]

Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But there'll be something missing

Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails

So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You'll go to hell
For what your dirty mind is 

[Trackname: Weird Fishes/ Arpeggi]

In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?

I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me into phantoms (Way out)
I follow to the edge (Way out)
Of the earth (Way out)
And fall off
Yeah, everybody leaves (Way out)
If they get the chance (Way out)
And this (Way out)
Is my chance

I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes

Yeah, I
I hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
I
I hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape


[Trackname: All I Need]

I'm the next act waiting in the wings
I'm an animal trapped in your hot car
I am all the days that you choose to ignore

You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

I am a moth who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you because there are no others

You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

It's all wrong, it's all wrong, it's all wrong
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's all wrong, it's alright
It's alright, it's 

[Trackname: Faust Arp]

One, two, three, four

Wakey wakey, rise and shine
It's on again, off again, on again
Watch me fall like dominoes
In pretty patterns
Fingers in the blackbird pie
I'm tingling, tingling, tingling
It's what you feel not what you ought to
What you ought to
Reasonable and sensible

Dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But not, not, not
For no real reason

Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
I take a bow, take a bow, take a bow
It's what you feel not what you ought to
What you ought to
The elephant that's in the room
Is tumbling, tumbling, tumbling
In duplicate and triplicate and
Plastic bags
In duplicate and triplicate
Dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But not, not, not
Exactly where do you get off
Is enough, is enough?
I love you but enough is enough
Enough of that stuff
There's no real reason

You've got a head full of feathers
You got melted to 

[Trackname: Reckoner]

Reckoner
You can't take it with you
Dancing for your pleasure

You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractor
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all hu–
All human beings

Because we separate like ripples on a blank shore
(In rainbows)
Because we separate like ripples on a blank shore
(In rainbows)

Reckoner
Take me with you
Dedicated to all hu–
All human 

[Trackname: House Of Cards]

I don't want to be your friend
I just want to be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it starts

Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
And fall off the table, get swept under
Denial, denial

The infrastructure will collapse
From voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband 'goodnight'

And forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Fall off the table, get swept under
Denial, denial
Denial, denial
(Your ears should be burning)
Denial, denial
(Your ears should be burning)

[Trackname: Jigsaw Falling Into Place]

Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back in focus again
The walls are bending shape
They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose

Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes 'round and 'round
The beat goes 'round and 'round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance
A jigsaw falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, and you look back
Not just once, and not just twice
Wish away your nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You got the light, you can feel it on your back
A light, you can feel it on your back
Your jigsaw falling into 

[Trackname: Videotape]

When I'm at the pearly gates
This'll be on my videotape, my videotape
When Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me
This is one for the good days
And I have it all here
In red, blue, green
In red, blue, green
You are my centre when I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape

This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
So I'm talking to you before-
No matter what happens now
You shouldn't be afraid
Because I know today has been
The most perfect day
I've ever
