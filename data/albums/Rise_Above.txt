[Trackname: What I See]
I wanna live, I wish that I was dead
I wanna live, I wish that I was dead
I've got to close my eyes, 'cause
I wanna live, I wish that I was dead
I wanna live, I wish that I was dead
I wanna live, I wish that I was dead
I've got to close my eyes, 'cause
I wanna live, I wish that I was dead
This feeling haunts me
Behind these eyes the shell seems so empty
Does anything live inside?
I wanna live, I wish that I was dead
I wanna live, I wish that I was dead
I've got to close my eyes, 'cause
I wanna live, I wish that I was dead
Life's cold
And it reaches inside
I reach to feel and to live
And turning my mind off
The desperation begins
And from the start
I can see the end
I wanna live, I wish that I was dead
I wanna live, I wish that I was dead
I've got to close my eyes, 'cause
I wanna live, I wish that I was dead

[Trackname: No More]

No, I won't believe that this is all
I'm not happy, I'm not free
No, I won't believe that this is all
Paycheck to paycheck
No, I won't believe that this is all
Every night I get drunk

I need action, won't take no more
It won't work out
It won't work no more
It won't work no more
No more, no more

Control for who? For what?
Reaction's masochism
Control for who? For what?
I'm no robot, they can get fucked
Control for who? For what?
I need to live, I need it now

I need action, won't take no more
It won't work out
It won't work no more
It won't work no more
No more, no more

[Trackname: Depression]

Right here
All by myself
I ain't got nobody else
The situation
The situation is bleeding me
There's no relief

Depression
Depression
Depression is gonna kill me tonight
Depression
Depression
Depression is gonna kill me tonight

I ain't got no friends to call my own
I just sit here all alone
There's no girls
There's no girls
There's no girls that wanna touch me
Get away I don't need your fucking sympathy

Depression is gonna kill me tonight
Depression
Depression
Depression is gonna kill me tonight
Depression
Depression
Depression gonna kill me
Everybody just get away
I'm gonna boil over inside
They say
They say things
They say things are gonna get better
All I know is they fucking better

Depression
Depression is gonna kill me tonight
Depression
Depression
Depression gonna kill me

[Trackname: Six Pack]

Thirty-five dollars and a six pack to my name
Spent the rest on beer so who is to blame?

I know it'll be OK
I've got a six pack in me alright!

They say I'm fucked up all the time
What they do is a waste of time

I know it'll be OK
I've got a six pack in me alright!

Senlaboreco a che rekordi alti
Popolo veni, popolo iri, popolo nask al morti, nask al morti, nask al morti

I was born with a bottle in my mouth
Now I got a six so I'll never run out

I know it'll be OK
I've got a six pack in me alright!
Senlaboreco a che rekordi alti
Popolo veni, popolo iri, popolo nask al morti, nask al morti, nask al morti

Thirty-five dollars and a six pack to my name
Spent the rest on beer so who's to blame?

I know it'll be OK

[Trackname: Thirsty and Miserable]

My brother wants a ride
To the liquor store
You pity him
You pity him for what he wants it for

Miserable and thirsty
Always wanting more
Miserable and thirsty
Always wanting more
More, more

It's now one-thirty
And we're all getting nervous
The store closes
The store closes at two
And there's not enough to last us

Miserable and thirsty
Always wanting more
Miserable and thirsty (thirsty and miserable)
Always wanting more
More, more
Miserable and thirsty
Always wanting more
Miserable and thirsty
Always wanting more
More, more

[Trackname: Police Story]

This fucking city is run by pigs
They take away the rights from all the kids
I walk down the street, I flip them off
They hit me across the head with a billy club
Nothing I do, nothing I say
I tell them to go get fucked, they put me away

Understand, we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us
We hate them
We can't win

I go to court for my crime
Stand in line, pay bail, I may serve time

Understand, we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us
We hate them
We can't win
Understand, we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us
We hate them
We can't win

[Trackname: Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie]

Gimmie, gimmie gimmie gimmie some more
Don't ask, don't ask don't ask what for
Gimmie, gimmie gimmie gimmie some more
Don't ask, don't ask don't ask what for

Gimmie, I need some more
Gimmie gimmie gimmie, don't ask what for
Gimmie, I need some more
Gimmie gimmie gimmie, don't ask what for

Sitting here I'm a loaded gun, waiting to go off
I've got nothing to do but shoot my mouth up

Gimmie, I need some more
Gimmie gimmie gimmie, don't ask what for
Gimmie, I need some more
Gimmie gimmie gimmie, don't ask what for
Gimmie, gimmie gimmie gimmie some more
Don't ask, don't ask don't ask what for
Gimmie, gimmie gimmie gimmie some more
Don't ask, don't ask don't ask what for
I know that the world's got problems
I've got problems of my own
Not the kind that can't be solved
That can't be solved
That can't be solved
That can't be solved

Gimmie, I need some more
Gimmie gimmie gimmie, don't ask what for
Gimmie, I need some more
Gimmie gimmie gimmie, don't ask what for
Gimmie, I need some more
Gimmie gimmie gimmie, don't ask what for
Gimmie, I need some more
Gimmie gimmie gimmie, don't ask what for

[Trackname: Spray Paint (The Walls)]

It feels good to say what I want
To knock things down
It feels good to see the disgust in their eyes

Oh I'm wanna go wild
And spray paint the walls
Oh I'm wanna go wild
And spray paint the walls

I don't want to see the plan succeed
There won't be room for people like me
My life is their disease
My life is their disease

Oh I'm wanna go wild
And spray paint the walls
Oh I'm wanna go wild
And spray paint the walls
Oh I'm wanna get wild
And spray paint the walls

[Trackname: Room 13]
Keep me alive
Only you can do it
If not, you'll die too
And I'll see to it
Keep me alive
I rely on your judgment, baby
I got none left of my own
I don't know what I'm doing
I need to belong
I need to hold on
I need to belong
I need to hold on

[Trackname: Rise Above]

Jealous cowards try to control
They distort what we say
Try to stop what we do, yeah
When they can't do it themselves
We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us but it's no use
Society's arms think they're smart
I find satisfaction in what they're lacking 'cause
We are born with a chance
And I am gonna have my chance

Rise above
Rise above

We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us but it's no use
Society's arms think they're smart
I find satisfaction in what they're lacking 'cause
We are born with a chance, oh
And I am gonna have my chance

Rise above
Rise above

[Trackname: Untitled]
There is a difference between
The knowledge of mastery
And the knowledge of nerdiness, I say
And isn't there a difference also
Between the mimicry of a possum
And of a raccoon when it has been treed
Flirtatiously you disagree
I wouldn't take you on backroads
The highway is suited for assholes
I know that you don't deserve that coming from me
And baby
Would you come with me
To Rhode Island
