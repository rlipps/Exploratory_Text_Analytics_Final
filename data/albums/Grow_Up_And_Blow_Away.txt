Grow up and blow away

Flooding the room two by two
From the womb to the holiday
There is no holiday
First, double-cross her heart
He wants to start a family
Needing something to go on

If she weren't writing in blood
She'd bring him her jokes, a new liver
And a shovel for the mud
If he were not knee-deep in mud
He'd bring her his drugs
He'd get her a typewriter

If this is the life
Why does it feel so good to die today?
Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away
If this is the life
Why does it feel so good to die today?
Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away
Nobody knows which street to take
He took the easy way
What was the easy way?
First, double-cross her heart
He wants to start a family
She always thought she would not

If she weren't writing in blood
She'd bring him her jokes, a new liver
And a shovel for the mud
If he were not knee-deep in mud
He'd bring her his drugs
He'd get her a typewriter

If this is the life
Why does it feel so good to die today?
Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away
If this is the life
Why does it feel so good to die today?
Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away
First, double-cross her heart
He wants to start a family
Her body is the baby

If this is the life
Why does it feel so good to die today?
Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away
If this is the life
Why does it feel so good to die today?
Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away

Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away
Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away
Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away
Blue to gray
Grow up and blow 

[Trackname: Hardwire]

Giving for chances to leave the basement life
I'm not the landlord's wife
Furnished room
Celebrate the first flight window
Bird's eye view

You hardwire, I'll try to play the guitar
Stay smoothly stoned, postpone the morning
Though we both see it coming, we don't run
Let the silence settle in our bones

You are everything
You are nothing at all
You are everything
You are nothing at all
You are every night
Fade to light
Fade to light the room
Daylight writes a new light on you

Giving for chances to take it all in stride
Why'd we walk a broken line of minus signs?
You hardwire, I'll try to play the guitar
Stay smoothly stoned, postpone the morning
Though we both see it coming, we don't run
Let the silence settle in our bones

You are everything
You are nothing at all
You are everything
You are nothing at all
You are every night
Fade to light
Fade to light the room
Daylight writes a new light on you

You leave your eyes there for me to memorise
I can see you happy in the shadows I despise

You hardwire
I'll try to play the guitar
You hardwire
I'll try to play the guitar
You hardwire
I'll try to play the guitar
You hardwire
I'll try to play the guitar

[Trackname: Rock Me Now]

The town where she was born, like the town where I was born was built by white settlers seeking gold and other treasures
Like me, she feels uncomfortable in the clothing of her ancestors
"It's not easy," she would say, ripping her fingers into the ashtray, "It's not easy to erase your blood."

Rock me now (sing with me)
In the arms of cobwebs
Roll me out in the arms of cobwebs

Once, she found a man to treasure and together they'd planted flowers of warning, fearing frost
Late on shallow evenings while their enemies slept, they hammered the soil asking for answers in green
His value declined when he offered his name
Why did he offer?

His value declined when he offered his name
His value declined when he offered his name
(His fend gets spread on
Sitting on the avenue
Blame it on the dump truck
Blame it on the fuel
Transient, Transient
Everybody owes
Living on the dump truck, Living on fuel)
When she was seven years old, she saw a man get shot, but no one came for a long time because it happened in a remote parking lot in Las Vegas
And she was waiting for her mom to come back from working the blackjack table at the Circus Circus casino
And that night, her mom said that the two of them and the now dead guy were the only three people who ever really lived in Las Vegas
Everybody else just arrived, ate their complimentary shrimp cocktail, and left

Rock me now in the arms of cobwebs (it's a one room city, yeah)
Roll me out (so can you roll with me?)
In the arms of cobwebs (it's a one room city, yeah)
His value declined when he offered his name

It's a one room city, yeah
It's a one room city, yeah
The wall to wall to wall to wall goes to street to street to street

[Trackname: The Twist]

We were too wasted to close the window
Friends and family looking in to my only hiding place
The rhythm of a stranger's skin
Infidel to die for what I am doing
Will happen in the morning
When the mirror won't recognise me

He knows a certain gesture
When we're loving to ask each other
Do you want it?
Do you want me?
I want it
It is you
You are where I want to be

Who is he? (oh)
Why would I (do)
Hitch a ride? (the)
I can drive (twist)
Who is she? (oh)
Why would I (do)
Hitch a ride (the)
When I can drive? (twist)
Somebody put me back in school
I forget everything I used to know
How to leave the boy behind without having to watch him go
Oh, infidel to die for what I am doing
Will happen in the morning
When the mirror won't recognise me

He knows a certain gesture
When we're loving to ask each other
Do you want it?
Do you want me?
I want it
It is you
You are where I want to be

Who is he? (Circumstantial)
Why would I (do)
Hitch a ride? (the)
I can drive (twist)
Who is she? (Circumstantial)
Why would I (do)
Hitch a ride (the)
When I can drive? (twist)
Circumstantial (oh)
Do the twist (do)
Circumstantial (the)
Do the twist (twist)
Circumstantial (oh)
Do the twist (do)
Circumstantial (the twist)
Always
Circumstantial (oh)
Do the twist (do)
Circumstantial (the)
Do the twist (twist)
Circumstantial (oh)
Do the twist (do)
Circumstantial (the twist)


[Trackname: On the Sly]

Wipe it up, you're capable of putting back a few when you have to
Re-memorize the history of your body, like a virgin
Ladies' night, '80s night
The kids get high and eat TV
So do we
For Halloween, I want to be Lenny Bruce

I want them to hate me
(I want them to hate me)
I want them to hate me
(I want them to hate me)
I want them to hate me
So you can love me on the sly

My old flame broke thebar blues just to prove he could
He pays the airline DJs now
He is everywhere

I want him to hate me
(I want him to hate me)
I want him to hate me
(I want him to hate me)
I want him to hate me
So you can love me on the sly
I want him to hate me
(I want him to hate me)
I want him to hate me
I don't feel so far away from you lately
Love me on the sly

Fill me in on horrible
How much is there?
Where else can I live?
The dirty sugar factory on the water
(On the water)
Should smell sweet

I want them to hate me
I want them to hate me
I don't feel so far away from you lately
Love me on the sly
I want them to hate me
I want them to hate me
I don't feel so far away from you lately
Love me on the sly
I want them to hate me
I want them to hate me
I don't feel so far away from you lately
Love me on the sly

[Trackname: Soft Rock Star]

Climbed the wall to make the sun rise in time
But the night had already begun
Climbed the wall to make the sun rise in time
But the night had already begun
Now here I am, I am the one
So hang high, soft star
Don't shine before swine

Not a lot of room to move
Ah, so where's my guide?
I tried looking up to you girls
Please correct me, but didn't you let the work slide?
Capitalize on a novelty, cheap pink spotlight

"Choose the highest bidder," was my answer
When they told me I was up for sale
Schoolyard, junior high style
Bullies have always tried to buy the better girls
But failed until now

Bubblegum ball martini
Is nothing like d√©panneur red wine
Travel through time
Who were you after?
You were mine
"Choose the highest bidder," was my answer
When they told me I was up for sale
Schoolyard, junior high style
Bullies have always tried to buy the better girls
But failed until now

So hang high
Soft rock star
Hang high
Soft rock star
Don't shine before swine

"Choose the highest bidder," was my answer
When they told me I was up for sale
Schoolyard, junior high style
Bullies have always tried to buy the better girls, haven't they?
"Choose the highest bidder," was my answer
When they told me I was up for sale
Schoolyard, junior high style
Bullies have always tried to buy the better girls
But failed until now
So hang high

[Trackname: Raw Sugar]

Sort of wonder why
No one said a word
Don't you like it on the sly?
Don't you like it 'til it hurts?
Have I been on your mind?
What's a voice without a song?
Something in your head
You've been fighting all along

I don't want to say it
The news is not so good
We'll never get away
And even if we could
We'd just play the tambourine
Around an open flame
Oversleep and burn
To be back in the game

'Cause summer never comes
Nowhere near high noon
And winter never comes
Nor the harvest moon
Raw sugar
I don't want to die living in a high rise grave
I pay to call home
Save that date
High rise grave
Raw sugar
I don't want to die living in a high rise grave
I pay to call home
Save that date
High rise grave

No, I'm not complaining
Yes, it could be worse
Ferment on the wishbone
Match the lips to the purse
Neighborhood's a runway
Fry the ass and thighs
Dirty denim dealers
Pushed behind the eyers

And summer never comes
Nowhere near high noon
And winter never comes
Nor the harvest moon
Raw sugar
I don't want to die living in a high rise grave
I pay to call home
Save that date
High rise grave
Raw sugar
I don't want to die living in a high rise grave
I pay to call home
Save that date
High rise grave

Still, I wear the red dress
Paint my toes and twirl
Take it back to old times
When I was still a girl
'Cause now, I'm all baboon boys
Coochie coochie coo
Sort of wonder why
I missed a kiss for you

'Cause summer never comes
Winter never comes
Summer never comes
Winter never comes
Summer never comes
Summer never comes
The summer never 

[Trackname: White Gold]

Piss-poor, riding high
Sunbathing fireside
We're here for the porn and the sirloin
Get your T-bone
Let your backbone slide
Tunnel and sky collide
Lose friends to the airwaves and the airlines

I wanna make it right
Some future in my eyes, bright
Hush, don't explain
When you water down my name
I'll be up too late
Call me when you get
Better at your game
You haven't beat me yet

The waitress
The actress
Got the skin and the bones
With a hairbrush and an air brush
She'd be white gold
She asked the piss-poor, "Why you looking for that party in the sky?
It's just a movie about a movie, too old to die."
But I'm gonna make it right
The future in my eyes, bright
Hush, don't explain
When you water down my name
I'll be up too late
Call me when you get
Better at your game
You haven't beat me yet
Though my vision is straining
I'm gonna make it right
Some future in my eyes, bright
Hush, don't explain
When you water down my name
I'll be up too late
Call me when you get
Better at your game
You haven't beat me yet

[Trackname: London Halflife]
Middle-aged, do the low rise on the waist
London half-life
Middle-aged, you the low-riser?
A little over wise, up late
And if you compromised
Drive your car through the rain
And if you've been beaten
Drive your car through the rain
Until you wash off the boss
Don't pull over 'til you're sure
One that wanted the floor
One that won't know the street
One that wanted to land
On the hearth with his feet up
Won't watch out
You're only better off in half your life
Over wise wasted
Over wise wasted
House of cards, you fall hard

[Trackname: Soft Rock Star [Jimmy vs. Joe Mix]]

Climbed the wall to make the sunrise in time
But the night had already begun
Climbed the wall to make the sunrise in time
But the night had already begun
Now here I am, I am the one
So hang high, soft star
Don't shine for swine

Not a lot of room to move us
Where is my guide?
I tried looking up to you, girls
Please correct me, but didn't you let the work slide?
Capitalize on a novelty, cheap pink spotlight
Is it alright?

"Choose the highest bidder," was my answer
When they told me I was up for sale
Schoolyard, junior high style
Bullies have always tried to buy the better girls but failed now
The check is in the mail

Bubble gumball martini
Is nothing like d√©panneur red wine
Travel through time
Who were you after you were mine?
"Choose the highest bidder," was my answer
When they told me I was up for sale
Schoolyard, junior high style
Bullies have always tried to buy the better girls, haven't they?
Choose the brightest future
Pay the debt and try to buy the better girls, but fail until now
The check is in the mail

So hang high
Soft rock star
Hang high
Soft rock star
Don't shine before swine
