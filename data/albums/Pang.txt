[Trackname: The Gate]

Standing at the gate
I come here every day
Just to see your face
Just to hear you say
"There's no need to wait
We will be okay
'Cause finally there's a way
To be both free and safe

[Trackname: Pang]

There's a look in your eyes when you're hungry for me
It's a beautiful knife cutting right where the fear should be

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

Tell me what you're afraid of
Tell me what night is made of
What can I not destroy for you?
Color the night electric
Get in me like a secret
I open the door and you run through

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me
Color the night electric
Get in me like a secret
I open the door and you run through

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

(Tell me what you're afraid of)
There's a look in your eyes when you're hungry for me

It's a beautiful knife cutting right where the fear should be

Into me

[Trackname: New Normal]

Now, what is this?
Feeling I know you from long ago
From deep in my past
I don't know why
Why I trust you completely
Don't question it
The bottle is empty

Now, what is this?
Club closing early
The fog machines
And lasers swirling
It's Halloween
I'm sorry for screaming
But I'm afraid
I scare you completely

Now, what is this?
Blizzard in April
I'm underdressed as usual
And we're cheating death
Buying time from the winter
It's house arrest
No stopping for dinner
Now, what is this?
Microphone working
Can't hear myself
But cameras are rolling
And there's the cue
My heart, it beats so hard
I look for you and suddenly fall

Now, what is this?
Robin you rescued
Its broken wing
Not broken long
You search the room
Someone yells from the garden
The orange cat
Finished what he started

Now, what is this?
Skidding of tires
I hold my breath
And you're running fast
As the SUV
Smashes into the sidewalk
And
Won't answer the call
Now, what is this?
Hollywood ghost town
A shootout scene
No actors at all
Last night I dreamed
You and I were immortal
It's no big deal
This new kind of 

[Trackname: Hit Me Where It Hurts]

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts

Bullseye, dead end
Moving target
Carousel, carousel
Baggage, claim it
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out, ride it out

Magic carpet
Over London
Through the ceiling
Watch you dreaming
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out
I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

Blind spot, Achilles' heel
Long shot, left field
Vertigo, vertigo
High stakes, popped ears
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out, ride it out

Do you feel safe?
(Hit me where it hurts now)
Now that you found my gun?
I'll be the nurse

You'll be my number one
Hit me where it hurts now
Hit me where it hurts

Hit me where it hurts

[Trackname: I Give Up]

When I stop caring, you stop caring
When I care less and you care less than me
When I don't need and I don't believe in
The hollow phrases you still repeat
You and I, we fall apart
Now I know what it means to unravel
It's a new and shallow grief
A pathetic kind of sad relief

It didn't used to feel this good to be all alone
Doing every damn thing I can to not go home

I give up
I give up on you now
I give up
How far can you fall
When you're already down?

I gave you that told-you-so look that makes you crazy
And you gave me that list of things about myself to change
And now these days, it's every night, babe
It's not a rough patch, it's not a phase
You and I, we fall apart
Now I know what it means to unravel
It's a new and shallow grief
An apathetic kind of self-defeat
It didn't used to feel this good to be all alone
Doing every damn thing I can to not go home

I give up
I give up on you now
I give up
How far can you fall
When you're already down?
I give up
I give up on you now
I give up
How far can you fall
When you're already down

[Trackname: Look At Me Now]

Wrote myself a letter
Just a single question
When you finally get this
Where will you be?
Will you be a shipwreck or a star
Falling for a boy who doesn't play guitar?
Now rewind the tape back to the start
Said I'd never leave you, but here we are

And you can't look at me now
I haven't changed, I'm still the same
But you can't look at me now
A hand grenade to throw away

Now my friends all tell me
"Girl, you're getting skinny
Have you not been sleeping?"
How could I be?
Trying to find the lightswitch in the dark
Burying the good girl I know I'm not
Now rewind the tape back to the start
Said I'd never leave you, but here we are
And you can't look at me now
I haven't changed, I'm still the same
But you can't look at me now
A hand grenade to throw away

I can't run anymore
Gotta stay right here and face the storm
I can't run anymore
Where the wake-up call is all I know
I can't run anymore
(I can't run anymore)
Gotta stay right here and face the storm
I can't run anymore
(I can't run anymore)

You can't look at me now
I haven't changed, I'm still the same
But you can't look at me now
A hand grenade to throw away
Look at me now
(I can't run anymore)
You can't look at me now
(I can't run anymore

[Trackname: Insomnia]

How long can sunlight stay warm in a stone?
How long 'til the bath runs cold?

Come dawn, come day, come half-awake
Come blue, come gray, come waves that break
And it's not enough
No reply, no relief

Dreams of dry fields
That once were green
Burned by someone just like me

Come dawn, come day, come half-awake
Come blue, come gray, come waves that break
And it's not enough
No reply, no relief

Hold on
Hold on
To save a single living piece of us
I still got it
I still got your 

[Trackname: Ocean of Tears]

This is gonna be torture
Before it's sublime
Does that make it crazy?
Cash in all of my courage
Before you're all mine
Does that make it crazy?

Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
To pull you close and tangle up with you real tight
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears
Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
Just an inch away from living a dream life
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Show me the future
Yeah, I'm all eyes
Tell me you're ready (I'm ready)
Pulse was rising and racing and racing and racing
But it's a long ride
Tell me you're ready
Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
To pull you close and tangle up with you real tight
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears
Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
Just an inch away from living a dream life
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Someone stop me, I'm coming down
Ooh, ooh
Someone stop me, I'm coming down
Ooh, ooh

Show me the fu-fu-fu-, fu-fu-
Yeah, all 

[Trackname: Hey Big Eyes]

I can picture you right now
Ata window seat
Cryingfor nobody except the world
I can picture you right now
Running down the street
Latefor nobody except the moon

Hey,big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me?
Hey,red star, can you burn
Burn down to me?

Picture me all messed up now
Can't talk to nobody
Canâ€™tplan for anything
Except the rain
Today the flags will all fly green
At the embassies
You're here next to me
Except you're not

Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me? (Swim, swim)
Hey, red star, can you burn
Burn down to me? (Burn, burn)
Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me?
Hey, red star, can you burn?
Burn down, burn down

Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me? (Swim, swim)
Hey, red star, can you burn
Burn down to me? (Burn, burn

[Trackname: Go As a Dream]

Someone changed the clock
And left the window open
When I must have drifted off
And it's just your kind of trick
To leave me empty-handed
Leave me with a riddle unsolved

Ah, ah, mmm
I don't know if I can do this
I don't know if I can make this peace

And you're almost like that card
Played by the magician
But this time, you're not coming back
And it's slipping through my fists
Blurry at the edges
Leaving only legend

You go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream
Ah, ah, mmm
I don't know if I can do this
I don't know if I can make this peace

And it hit me like a brick
A joke without a punchline
A script that nobody read
If you saw me lying here
Through my bedroom ceiling
You would have me pick up my head and

Go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream

Ah, ah, mmm
Ah, ah, 

[Trackname: Caroline Shut Up]

Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much?
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
'Cause there's only one way
One way to find out
If it ever gets better than right now

I dare you to come closer
Let me see you in the light
I dare you to stay with me
You know I get low sometimes
I dare you to make time stop
Instead of speeding up, up
I dare you to go slow, don't rush

Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much?
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
'Cause there's only one way
One way to find out
If it ever gets better than right now

Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Now you got me jealous and I'm not the jealous type
Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Spending all the cash that I was saving up
Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Lying in the bath, spit out a fountain of wine
Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Looking like a god, you know you fuck me up
Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much?
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
'Cause there's only one way
One way to find out
If it ever gets better than right now

And this is hardcore
Give me scissors and I'm running on a tightrope
And I've gotta trust it now, ah
Just don't let go
(Sometimes I, sometimes I, sometimes I)

Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much?
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
If tomorrow, you want me
Then I don't have a doubt
That it gets even better than right

Not like I'm counting the days (Ah, ah, ah)
But it's been twenty-five (Ah, ah, ah)
You're out there killing the game (Ah, ah, ah)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mmm)

Get a little more close to me

[Trackname: Door]

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Perpetual novice
Signature on a check made out to you

Took ten laps 'round the planet
To prove what I wasn't
And the door slams hard behind you
When you leave the house of judgment

Been waiting for regret to hit me
Some kind of reckoning
I waited for the drop, 'cause lately
The yang comes with yin

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Perpetual novice
Signature on a check made out to you
Now there's the sunset
Salt in the wound, yeah
Sometimes I don't know who I'm singing to
Who is the you who I sing to
When the house is empty?
You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you
You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you

And we're waking up sore and dizzy
From a ten-year concussion
And the rainfall makes you miss me
Even though you say it doesn't

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Back in the city
Everything's different when we're not together

You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you
You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you
Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Perpetual novice
Signature on a check made out to you
Now there's the sunset
Salt in the wound, yeah
Sometimes I don't know who I'm singing to
Who is the you who I sing to
When the house is empty?

You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you
You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you

[Trackname: Parachute]

Awake from a dream
One that started as a nightmare
Like a war so extreme
It erased itself from memory
Here's where I jumped
From the aeroplane without questioning it
The curve of the coast of Los Angeles
Spreading itself below

And blooming overhead, the parachute
I've got to trust it now, oh

Change in the wind
And I'm drifting from the crescent
Pulled farther out
From the shore than where I can swim to it

And blooming overhead, the parachute
I've got to trust it now, oh

Closing in on the sparkle of the waves
Go on, take me, it will feel like going home
Go on, take me, I'm not afraid to drown
What is this, pulling me back the other way
To strip malls, highways and treetops?
Landing on the soft
