[Trackname: Too Much Love]

What will you say when the day comes
When it's no fun

What will you do when you wake up
Fatten you up
Fasten you up
Fatten you up
No memories to get cloudy
To get cloudy
When you can't see
What you can't see
It's all the same when it's morning
And you're boring
Still ignoring
Everything
No memories to remind you of the old you
Nothing for it
Just keep it up

[Trackname: Tribulations]

Everybody makes mistakes
But I feel alright when I come undone
You are not making me wait
But it seems alright as long as something's happening
I try to make you late
But you fighting me off like a fire does
You try making me wait
But it feels alright as long as something's happening

Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations

You try to make me wait
You come around when it's come undone
Everybody makes you late
And it's never you because you're always thinking
I try making you wait
And give you me some like you give it good
Everybody makes mistakes
But it seems it's mine that always keep on stinging

Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
You try making me wait
But you come undone when you come undone
Everybody makes mistakes
But it's always mine that seem to keep on sticking

[Trackname: Movement]

It's like a movement from the small place
To a bigger city
Or it's a bigger bag to strap the ego of a little baby
It's like a discipline without the discipline of
All of the discipline
It's like a culture
Without the effort of all of the culture

Oh but I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
You're yesterday
And I'm tapped
Another reason I'm tapped

It's like a movement
Without the bother of all of the meaning
It's like a discipline
Without the discipline of all of the discipline
It's like a fat guy in a T-shirt
Doing all the singing
It's like a couple dads and a few friends
Trying hard to stay in
You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy 'n I'm tapped
You're pillaging
And I'm tapped
For best results well I'm tapped

Here comes the report nothing to report see
It's all the same
It seems the punk rock as an experiment well
It pulled up lame
You got the fat guy in the T-Shirt
Doing all the singing
Straight to the drunk tank doing the research 'n
Doing all the blame

You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy 'n I'm tapped
You're pillaging
And I'm tapped
For best results well I'm tapped

[Trackname: Never as Tired as When I'm Waking Up]

Wasted and complacent
And you about the same
But still I wanna get it
On with you tonight
When I was a little boy
I laid down in the grass
I'm sure you'd feel the same if I
Can fuck you here tonight

But I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
No, I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
But it feels like I'm in love again
No, it feels like I'm in love again
Though it feels like I'm in love again
With what ya do

If we made it happen
I'm sure what we would do
We'd run outside and fuck someone
To show it didn't mean a thing
Seems it could be simple
If I could just grow up
Never gonna get it now
'Cause I'll never grow
But I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
No, I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
And it feels like I'm in love again
No, it feels like I'm in love again
Though it feels like I'm in love again
With what ya do
But not with you

(I keep on telling myself it's you) But not with you
(I keep on telling myself it's you) But not with you
(I keep on telling myself it's you) But not with you
(I keep on telling myself it's you) I'm not with you

[Trackname: On Repeat]
A beat's on repeat, beating on me
From every car in the street
It's a constant repeat, on repeat
Of your paranoid heartbreaking beats
On repeat
It's a five song repeat beating on me
Your favorite band helps you sleep
And here comes the new stylish creep
From every car in the street
On repeat
On repeat
On repeat
Don't tell nobody what, what you really want because
They can tell everybody else what you really want
Then you're fucked, so act like it's for yourself or it's all yours
And they go and tell everybody else that you're really great
We are just people
You're enfranchised and entranced
You're enfranchised and entrenched
But know that it's yours!
Real life's a compromise
But your beats are half-assed, streak is beating on me
Well, I'm drinking, the weak is helping me sleep
I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would run the streets
And come to every show, no one wants that
I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would flee the schools
And come to every show, drugged and unwashed
I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would line the streets
And come to every show unwashed and drugged and
Beats are on repeat, beating on me
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio
Beats are on repeat, beating on me
Beats on repeat, beating on me

You've been loose-knit
But I'm still all kills
I need my thrills
I need my thrills
I'm on fire
Because you want me

But all of my desire
Is going to crush me
When you expire
But I'm still all kills
But you want me
Because you want me
But I'm still all kills
When its all pills
I need my thrills
Thrills, thrills, thrills
Don't you make me wanna wake up

Next to you
Thrills, thrills, thrills
Don't you make me wanna wake up

But I was there
I was there in
I was there at the first Can show in Cologne
I'm losing my edge
I'm losing my edge to the kids whose footsteps I hear when they get on the decks
I'm losing my edge to the Internet seekers who can tell me every member of every good group fromto
I'm losing my edge
To all the kids in Tokyo and Berlin
I'm losing my edge to the art-school Brooklynites in little jackets and borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered Eighties
But I'm losing my edge
I'm losing my edge, but I was there
I was there
But I was there
I'm losing my edge
I'm losing my edge
I can hear the footsteps every night on the decks
But I was there
I was there inat the first Suicide practices in a loft in New York City
I was working on the organ sounds with much patience
I was there when Captain Beefheart started up his first band
I told him, "Don't do it that way. You'll never make a dime."
I was there
I was the first guy playing Daft Punk to the rock kids
I played it at CBGB's
Everybody thought I was crazy
We all know
I was there
I was there
I've never been wrong
I used to work in the record store
I had everything before anyone
I was there in the Paradise Garage DJ booth with Larry Levan
I was there in Jamaica during the great sound clashes
I woke up naked on the beach in Ibiza in
But I'm losing my edge
To better-looking people
With better ideas and more talent
And they're actually really, really nice
I'm losing my edge
