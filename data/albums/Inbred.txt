[Trackname: Crush]

His window’s already passed
So he’s shooting at the glass
Keeping guns in his locker
And he denies it
Like it’s actually important
But he lied 'cause I sure did watch him
Showing up wearing black
And he knows that
His daddy’s on death row
But he’ll say it with his chest, though
His friends move dope
He hasn’t tried coke
But he’s always had a problem saying no
His older brother bagged the valedictorian
His mother steady screaming he should be more like him

Can you read my mind? I’ve been watching you
(You know it, you know it, you know it, you know it’s true)
Couldn’t fight to save your lifе but you look so cool
Camo jacket robbing corner stores
Hard odds to bеat when you’re on all fours
Good men die too so I’d rather be with you
I owe you a black eye and two kisses
Tell me when you wanna come and get em
I only want him if he says it first to me
I wanna … him in the back of his mom’s Mercury
He looks like he works with his hands
And smells like Marlboro reds
It makes me so … and I can’t get enough of it
Something’s been feeling weird lately
There’s just something about you, baby
Maybe I’ll just be crazy
And piss him off ‘til he hates me
(Yeah right, he fucking loves me)
Low slung bad bitch, baby come and get you some

Can you read my mind? I’ve been watching you
Couldn’t fight to save your life but you look so cool
(You know it, you know it, you know)
Camo jacket robbing corner stores
Hard odds to beat when you’re on all fours
Good men die too so I’d rather be with you
Oh, I’d rather be with you
Oh, I’d rather be with you
'Cause good men die too so I’d rather be with 

[Trackname: Unpunishable]

Down bad and nasty
Sacrificial angel, dirty slut with needs
In a convocation or a room alone
Call me what you want and I'll be that
Sucking on his teeth, he needs it so bad
He's screaming "Party's over, go the fuck home"

The darker the fruit, the sweeter
I ask him if he's ok with that
He's mean, I'm meaner
My baby says that he's not afraid of that
I say "You're right, in a way"
Giving it up on top of him
He says, "How so, babe?"
He wants to know how

Babe
I'm too good for you
And it makes me need it even more
Whose is it now
It's yours
Red and blue
Used and abused
It's still never enough
I'm unpunishable
Swollen up with envy
Says I'm his favorite
Yeah, I fucking better be
Drifting just right out of sight
Show me where it hurts and I'll
Lick it better
In the red light

Numb faces in a dark bar
We don't even know where we are
I don't even know who you are

I don't even know who you are, babe
I'm too good for you
And it makes me need it even more
Whose is it now
It's yours
Red and blue
Used and abused
It's still never enough
I'm unpunishable

[Trackname: Inbred]

Bare naked under my nightgown
Pissing on the stove to put it out
Watching him through holes in his door
Sucking on the back of his leg to stay warm
Older brother made a name for himself with the cops
Scumbag fuck but I swear that he’s not
He’s so good to me and to nobody else
So you should watch yourself
Mama’s comatose, she can’t leave the bed
Something smells rotten and it's starting to spread
I’m bad, he’s worse, we’re already dead
We’re already dead

We wake up and all the fucking lights are out

You can’t win ‘em all
Who knows how much longer
I’ll lay on the floor
Touch me 'til I vomit
I’m not scared of god
I’m scared he was gone all along
Who will take the fall
Who of us is stronger
You’ll just want it more
If you could, you’d have fought it
But you know you’re not
From the start, they knew you were wrong
You were wrong
Older brother made a name for himself with the feds
White trash dick but I love him to death
He’s so good to me and to nobody else
So you can fuck yourself
You get off on innocence so you savor this
Does your baby know her daddy’s a rapist?
He hates the way you look at me
You’re already dead
You’re already dead

If he wakes up, he’ll show you what i’m talking about

You can’t win ‘em all
Who knows how much longer
I’ll lay on the floor
Touch me 'til I vomit
(Touch me 'til) I’m not scared of god
I’m scared he was gone all along
Who will take the fall
Who of us is stronger
You’ll just want it more
If you could, you’d have fought it
But you know you’re not
From the start, they knew you were wrong
You were wrong
You were wrong
You were 

[Trackname: Two-Headed Mother]
You know
You know
You know
You know
You think that you create the waves
But I create you
Two-headed mother in your bed
You know she hates you
Kissing tyrannical heads spitting at you
Babe, fire you wade through
The ways I fuck myself and get down good
Never need to mind you
I’ve loved before, I’ll kill again
You’re just the worst of all my men
I’m not gon’ pull you out the den so they don’t bite you
I won’t feel good again until I’m up inside you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I’ll love 'til I'm sore
I don’t love you
I don’t love you
I don’t love you
I don’t love you no morе
Two-headed mother pullеd you from the black
And she can send you back
