[Trackname: Rock and Sing]

Without his body
Naked and bare
Quiet and obviously not there
I am that naked thing swimming in air
Why does that mean anything?
Why do you stare?

Lean on your table
Ask what you want of me
I am unable
Cry with me, cry with me

Within this body
Confuse
Confuse my home for a refuge
I don't want to be scared of (I don't want to be scared of)
Anybody coming in (Anybody coming in)
I don't want to lock my door anymore

Hand me that cable
Plug into anything
I am unstable
Rock and sing‚ rock and sing

[Trackname: Forgotten Eyes]

Forgotten eyes are the ones which we lose
Forgotten hands are the ones which we choose
To let go of, but it is no less a bruise
On the collective arm keeping us high and gone
Forgotten dance is the one left at birth
Forgotten plants in the fossils of earth
And they've long passed but they are no less the dirt
Of the common soil keeping us dry and warm

The wound has no direction
Everybody needs a home and deserves protection‚ hmm-mm

Hollow-eyed on Eddie Street‚ no sirens to hear
Just trash and soiled needles clawing the veneer
And no crying but it is no less a tear
On the common cheek with which we smile
Hollow-eyed on Eddie‚ is it they or is it I?
Is it me who is more hollow as I'm quickly passing by?
And the poison is killing them, but then so am I
As I turn away

The wound has no direction
Everybody needs a home and deserves protection, hmm-mm
Forgotten tongue is the language of love
Forgotten tongue is the language of love
Forgotten tongue is the language of love
Forgotten 

[Trackname: The Toy]

What a fool, familiar dream
I wake up laughing and running
From the boy crying and calling
'Cause the toy in my hand is real

What a tomb we're building here
In the sphere, that's where we all die
In the eye, that's where I'm living
The toy in my hand is real

In the room, her warm hands play
On my breast, what is she singing?
The form ringing and ringing
'Cause the toy in my hand is real
The toy in my hand is real

Charcoal womb, the jet planes purr
And the croon, distant as paper
Children burn, faceless vapor
'Cause the toy in my hand is real
Yes, the toy in my hand is real

[Trackname: Two Hands]

You somehow let me down
Both hands and a gentleman
You could not take me through
New plans or tell me who
New friends, I can make some too
I know
You somehow took me in
Both arms, my marked up skin
Two hands, places you had been
I needed

And the more that we try
To figure through the answers
To repeat ourselves
To deny, deny

Now you call my bluff
All clear and it gets so rough
Stone-faced in the light
The air and the jagged bite
Cold air, the wisdom of the night
Between us
And the more that we try
To figure through the answers
To repeat ourselves
To deny, deny
To deny, deny, deny

Somehow we exist
In the folds, and now we'll kiss
Both hands, the mystery before us
She's reaching
But I could not take you through
New plans, or tell you who
New friends, you can make some too
I 

[Trackname: Those Girls]

Dropped call, mid fall
Only you can know for now
Island, demons
Only you can hold them down

Those girls might hear me crying
The one, the only jealousy I have is dying
With all along, your arms around me
Try

Island, demons
Zoë, you come over now
'Cause those girls keep telling me things
And only you can hold them down

Those girls might hear me crying
The one, the only jealousy I have is dying
With all along, your arms around me
Try

Those girls might hear me cry
The one, the only jealousy I have is dying
With all along, your arms around me
Try

[Trackname: Shoulders]

Please wake up
Please wake up
Touch my skin and
Tell me where you've been
You brought me in
You brought me in
So touch my skin and
Tell me where you've been
You showed me how
To keep myself from burning out

They found you in the morning
The blood was on your shoulders
They found you at the corner
Your head was doubled over
And the blood of the man
Who killed my mother with his hands
Is in me, it's in me, in my veins

Please wake up
Please wake up
Touch my skin and
Tell me where you've been
You brought me in
My best friend
So touch my skin and
Tell me where you've been
You showed me how
To hold my sin
And kiss the bad ways I have been
They found you in the morning
The blood was on your shoulders
They found you at the corner
Your head was doubled over
And the blood of the man
Who's killing our mother with his hands
Is in me, it's in me, in my veins
It's in me, it's in me, in my veins

[Trackname: Not]

It's not the energy reeling
Nor the lines in your face
Nor the clouds on the ceiling
Nor the clouds in space
It's not the phone on the table
Nor the bed in the earth
Nor the bed in the stable
Nor your stable words
It's not the formless being
Nor the cry in the air
Nor the boy I'm seeing
With her long black hair
It's not the open weaving
Nor the furnace glow
Nor the blood of you bleeding
As you try to let go

It's not the room
Not beginning
Not the crowd
Not winning
Not the planet
Not spinning
Not a ruse
Not heat
Not the fire lapping up the creek
Not food
Not to eat
Not the meat of your thigh
Nor your spine tattoo
Nor your shimmery eye
Nor the wet of the dew
It's not the warm illusion
Nor the crack in the plate
Nor the breath of confusion
Nor the starkness of slate

It's not the room
Not beginning
Not the crowd
Not winning
Not the planet
Not spinning
Not a ruse
Not heat
Not the fire lapping up the creek
Not food
Not to eat

Not what you really wanted
Nor the mess in your purse
Nor the bed that is haunted
With the blanket of thirst
It's not the hunger revealing
Nor the ricochet in the cave
Nor the hand that is healing
Nor the nameless grave
It's not the room
Not beginning
Not the crowd
Not winning
Not the planet
Not spinning
Not a ruse
Not heat
Not the fire lapping up the creek
Not food
Not to eat
Not to die
Not dying
Not to laugh
Not lying
Not the vacant wilderness vying
Not the room
Not beginning
Not the crowd
Not winning
Not the planet
Not 

[Trackname: Wolf]
Hello to the morning moon
Woke up as you left the room
Pillow still warm
Scent like meadow grass
Has the feeling come to pass?
Has the feeling come to stay?
What can we say?
Wishing you would hang around
Living on the waterfront
Witnessing the gameless hunt
Mermaids don't kill
That's the way they sing so fine
Now your lips are on the line
Now there is a broken tongue
Met you so young
Felt so frozen
How you seem to follow through
On everything you yearn for
Steps so fair
So much certainty
Now as far as we can see
The water's getting deeper
My safekeeper
The wolf is howling for me
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
When she holds me in her jaw
All my blood dripping
Will I be free
To cease gripping?
Finally laying on the ground
Open hands empty
I'll return back again
If she'll let me
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Trackname: Replaced]

Move along through Santa Fe
Andmake a new beginning
What'sthat you were starting to say?
Or have you forgotten?

'Cause, 'cause the unlit moon would rather hide
Bereplaced by the mystery of the stars
Becausein your room, we gather
To be replaced by the mystery of the heart

Pullon your new wool coat
Try to remember the words you once wrote
The canyons that catch in your throat
The fault lines that carry and cradle the river

'Cause,'cause the unlit moon would rather hide
And be replaced by the mystery of the stars
Because in your room, we gather
To be replaced by the mystery of the heart (Go on, now)

Because, because the unlit moon would rather hide
Be replaced by the mystery of the stars
Because in your room, we gather
To be replaced by the mystery of the heart
To be replaced by the mystery

[Trackname: Cut My Hair]
Please cut my hair
Takeme to the kitchen
Whatare the chances you have a scissor?
Maybe a pair?
It's longer than I can even bear
Youwanna be alone
Useyour ammunition to empty your arm
You ask me to leave you, I won't
Notwhile the knife is at your throat
Annie reminds me
The diamond mines are burning
I push her around
Butshe keeps returning
Teeth drool and bared
Make a clean incision, hold me for ransom
Tell me I'm pretty, tell me I'm rare
Talk to the boy in me, he's there
We do-si-do
Swaying in the kitchen, rocking slowly
Tell him to sound the alarm
Is he gonna keep me safe from harm?
Annie reminds me
The diamond mines are burning
I push her around
But she keeps returning
