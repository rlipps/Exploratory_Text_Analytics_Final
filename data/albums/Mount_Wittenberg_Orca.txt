[Trackname: On and Ever Onward]

If you grow up in the river
The river's all you know
If you're swimming in the current
The current knows where you are gone
Ah, the current knows where you are gone

On and ever onward
Our home is all around us
On and ever onward
Our love is all around us

Tempur-Pedic is the ocean
Our backyard is the bay
From the morning to the evening
Swimming onward through the day
Ah, swimming onwards through the day

On and ever onward
Our love is all around us
On and ever onward

Our love is all around us
Our love is all around us
Our love is all around us
Our love is all around 

[Trackname: When the World Comes to an End]

I'm not sure I know
What I know is right and true
What I don't know I'm sure I feel
Right now with you

When the world comes to an end
I will have loved you
For a long time
For a long time

When I saw your slight smile
I wanted to know you
Until the day that I die
I am in love with you

When the world comes to an end
I will have loved you
For a long time
For a long time

When the world comes to an end
I will have loved you
For a long time
For a long time

[Trackname: Beautiful Mother]

Beautiful mother up ahead of us
Can you see us play inside the waves?
Beautiful woman on the ridge at dusk
Can you see us play among the waves?
We are swimming in a simple rhythm
We are swimming in a rhythm as the same voice
We are listening into how to sing our simple rhythm
Listen to our new song

Ha-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Ayyyy

Beautiful mother up ahead of us
Can you see us play inside the waves?
Beautiful woman on the ridge at dusk
Can you see us play among the waves?
We are swimming in a simple rhythm
We are swimming in a rhythm as the same voice
We are listening into how to sing our simple rhythm
Listen to our new song

Ha-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Ayyyyyyy
Beautiful mother up ahead of us

Ha-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Trackname: Sharing Orb]

Come into my home
Murder my family and leave me alone
Ceaseless hungering
Until the sea is silent and deadly quiet
But for an engine

There is another kind of light
As inside you is another resource
Enormous love, here's a sharing orb of water
We all call her our mother, mother

How do you say love?
Your love is a harpoon that seeks my blood
Ooh, never enough
Your weapons, your noises buzzing in my skull
They drive me upward into the deadly light

There's another kind of light
As inside you is another resource:
Enormous love, here's a sharing orb of water
We all call her our mother, mother

[Trackname: No Embrace]

I don't see
Water images appear in front of me
I am free
I am not bound to the difference between
The real and the real to me

And the only other one who I could ever believe
Is the one that I could feel but never really see
Looking from the island at the peak

You won't say why you would deny me your embrace
Swimming in the sea
I think I understand why you hate me
For what I've done, for what I haven't done

And the only other one who I could ever believe
Is the one that I could feel but never really see
Looking from the island at the 

[Trackname: All We Are]

In the nursery
Where ocean meets the shore
In the place where we could meet
You will be all alone

So as we angle to the new
Tow on a thawing frontier
Never a woman on the shore
A witness or a love

I looked out for you
But looking never meant less
I could feel that you were gone
And I despondent turned and left
I reached out for you
But reaching never meant less
I could feel that you were gone
And I despondent turned and left

So as we angle to the new
Tow on a thawing frontier
Never a woman on the shore
A witness or a love


We looked out across the long horizon
We looked in each other's eyes
And realized that we are only one
Through a moment we could glimpse an infinity
And through an infinity we could see
All in all is all we
