[Trackname: Market Fresh]

Market fresh
Stand by me
Where will it ever land

Scar and stains, Emily
Turn our little crab

I could have meant it if you let me

Market fresh
Stand by me
Where will it ever land

Scar and stains, Emily
Turn our little crab

I could have meant it if you let me

I'm frozen (I'm frozen I'm frozen I'm frozen I'm frozen) 

[Trackname: Backyards]

Broken boys look good sitting on their shoes
Silent waves responds expose to fear
Library cards, rented faces, line up and make a trade
Hard parades with nothing skin
Things that breathe way too thin

They lost their lives in backyards
They lost their lives in backyards

Elevator, red blue stain, best of things
Half way between things and times, a kill
Library cards, rented faces, line up and make a trade
Highways and major club smell stale, almost eyes, a thousand things


It's a hard parade, just be courageous
It's a hard parade, just
It's a hard parade
It's a hard parade, just be courageous
Be courageous
Hard parade just, be courageous
It's a hard parade just, be courageous

[Trackname: Da Da Da Da]
I think it's almost time

[Trackname: Time = Cause]

You come in, check my time
You have got fornication crimes
I've seen your hope on television
And they all want to love the cause

[Trackname: Lover's Spit]

All these people drinking lover's spit
They sit around and clean their face with it
And they listen to teeth to learn how to quit
Tied to a night they never met
You know it's time that we
Grow old and do some shit
I like it all that way
I like it all that way

All these people drinking lover's spit
Swallowing words while giving head
They listen to teeth to learn how to quit
Take some hands and get used to it

All these people drinking lover's spit
They sit around and clean their face with it
You know it's time that we
Grow old and do some shit
I like it all that way
I like it all that way
I like it all that way
