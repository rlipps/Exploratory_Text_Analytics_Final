[Trackname: Get Innocuous!]

Home, home in the late night
And away, away in the half light
Except Saturday, crushed by the boring
Until played and plagued by the tourists again
When once you had believed it
Now, you see it's sucking you in
To string you along with the pretense
And pave the way for the coming release

Alone and prone in the half light
And late, late to your real life
If you find a way into the gold rush
You will stay until the morning comes

You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?

[Trackname: Time to Get Away]

It's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
It's time to get away
It's time to get away from you

You brought a lot of money
But me, I'm catching tiny tummy
And you, you make me sleep
I try and try
But you undermine me, uh-huh
And I start to be sensible
If you know what I mean

And so it's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away
I'm dying to get away

And next time, we'll talk it over
And we can start again, shock

For you, I caught a lot of static
And me, I would like it automatic
What, what, what, what
What did you think would happen next?
What, what, what, what
What could it ever be?
So it's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away
I'm dying to get away

And next time, let's talk about it
Or maybe start again, shock

To think I used to pity you
To think I used to pity you, it's true
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to talk to you, it's true

Next time we could talk about it
Or even start again
I couldn't tell you what you wanted
You know what I'm saying?
I knew you were low, man
But the truth is, I was shocked

Fun, power, eyes
Eyes never lie
Kids ("Hey, buddy?" "What?")
Kids never lie

[Trackname: North American Scum]

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
We are North Americans
And for those of you who still think we're from England
We're not, no
We’ve been on planes and on trains 'til we think we might die
Far from North America
Where the buildings are old and you might have lots of mimes
Uh-huh, oh, oh
I hate the feelin' when you're lookin' at me that way
'Cause we're North Americans
But if we act all shy, it'll make it okay
Makes it go away
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
When we're North American
But in the end, make the same mistakes all over again
Come on, North Americans
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are North American scum
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh
We're from North America
And all the kids, all the kids don’t wanna make a scene
Here in North America
When all your kids get to read it in your magazines
We don't have those
So where's the love? Where's the love? Where's the love?
Where's the love? Where's the love, tonight?
But there's no love, man, there's no love when the kids are uptight
Uh, uh
So throw a party ‘til the cops come in and bust it up
Let's go, North Americans
Oh, you were planning it? I didn't mean to interrupt
Sorry
I did it once and my parents got pretty upset
Freaked out in North America
But then I said, "The more I do it, the better it gets"
That's my North America

(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are North American scum
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh
We're from North America
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are North American scum
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh
We are North American
New York's the greatest if you get someone to pay the rent
Wahoo, North America
And it's the furthest you can live from the government
Uh-huh, huh
Some fat American Christians might disagree
Here in North America
But New York's the only place we keep them off the street
Ooh, ooh
Now, we can't have parties like in Spain where they go all night
Shut down in North America
Or like Berlin where they go another night, alright
Uh-huh, uh-huh
You see, I love this place that I have grown to know
Alright, North America
And yeah, I know you wouldn't touch us with a ten-foot pole
'Cause we're North Americans

(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are North American scum
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh
We are North Americans
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are North American scum
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh
We love North America
(Ah-ah) Take me back to the states, man
North American scum
(Ah-ah) Where we can be in any one of a million new bands
North America
(Ah-ah) Where the DJ gigs aren't as fun
Here in North American scum
(Ah-ah) But don't blame the Canadians
Look out, North 

[Trackname: Someone Great]

I wish that we could talk about it
But there, that's the problem
With someone new, I couldn't start it
Too late for beginnings
The little things that made me nervous
Are gone in a moment
I miss the way we used to argue
Locked in your basement

I wake up and the phone is ringing
Surprised, as it's early
And that should be a perfect warning
That something's a problem
To tell the truth, I saw it coming
The way you were breathing
But nothing can prepare you for it
The voice on the other end

The worst is all the lovely weather
I'm stunned it's not raining
The coffee isn't even bitter
Because, what's the difference?
There's all the work that needs to be done
It's late for revision
There's all the time and all the planning
And songs to be finished
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming 'til the day it stops
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming 'til the day it stops
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming 'til the day it stops

I wish that we could talk about it
But there, that's the problem
With someone new, I couldn't start it
Too late for beginnings
You're smaller than my wife imagined
Surprised you were human
There shouldn't be this radio silence
But what are the options?

When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
We're safe for the moment
Saved for the 

[Trackname: All My Friends]

That's how it starts
We go back to your house
You check the charts
And start to figure it out
And if it's crowded, all the better
Because we know we're gonna be up late
But if you're worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
That's how it starts

And so it starts
You switch the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways that we show our age
And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
If the sun comes up and I still don't wanna stagger home
Then it's the memory of our betters
That are keeping us on our feet
You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
Oh, you're talking forty-five turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend

It comes apart
The way it does in bad films
Except the part
Where the moral kicks in
Though when we're running out of the drugs
And the conversation's grinding away
I wouldn't trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life
You drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
And the next ten people who are trying to be polite
When you're blowing eighty-five days in the middle of France
Yeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?
And to tell the truth
Oh, this could be the last time
So here we go
Like a sales force into the night
And if I made a fool, if I made a fool
If I made a fool on the road, there's always this
And if I'm sued into submission
I can still come home to this
And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
You can sleep on the plane or review what you said
When you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tanned
You think over and over, "Hey, I'm finally dead"
Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
You can turn it on yourself, you ridiculous clown
You forgot what you meant when you read what you said
And you always knew you were tired, but then

Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends

[Trackname: Watch the Tapes]

Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
I get all confused when you mix up the dates (Woo!)

Don't gimme the pretend, you come for the weekend
And you stay for the week
You say that you hate it, but that's how you made it
Just to keep it oblique
We're both high, high, high
High, high on lemon sips
We're all su-su-su—
Sucked in by parlour tricks

Oh, the people deceive you, the kids never leave
'Cause you make them at home
You try to appease them and they show you the stick
But still, you pick up the phone
But hey, man, you can take it
As long as they don't shove you out in the cold
It's not getting better, no, it's not getting better, man
It's just getting old
And ah-ooh! We do what we're programmed to do
Hey, we do what we're told
Ah-woo-hoo!
I never remember to carry my book
When I get on the bus
You never forget, but it's your time to pay up
When they are making a fuss
We're both high-high-high
High-high on lemon sips
We're all high-high-high
High-high on wiggling hips
And ah-ooh! You break off your plans for the weekend
And ah-ooh! You can tell them the dates
But that don't mean they're letting you go
Ah-woo-hoo! Go!
Ah-woo-hoo!

Don't gimme the pretend, you come for the weekend
And you stay for the year
Avoid all your plans 'cause we're making our day jobs
Into a steady career
We're both high-high-high
High-high on lemon sips
We all claw, claw, claw, claw
Climb on to sinking ships
And ah-ooh! Avoid all the cold sideways glances
And ah-ooh! Celebrate, celebrate, celebrate
And then turn to stone
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
You, you turnand now you're all out of escapes, c'mon

Hey, the rock writer told me to tell you:
"Though you're great and you're brave
You still lack that which makes you a star"

Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
We all get a little drunk and then we act like apes

[Trackname: New York, I Love You but You're Bringing Me Down]

New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down
New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down
Like a rat in a cage, pulling minimum wage
New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down

New York, you're safer and you're wasting my time
Our records all show you were filthy but fine
But they shuttered your stores when you opened the doors
To the cops who were bored once they'd run out of crime

New York, you're perfect, oh, please don't change a thing
Your mild billionaire mayor's now convinced he's a king
And so the boring collect, I mean all disrespect
In the neighborhood bars I'd once dreamt I would drink

New York, I love you, but you're freaking me out
There's a ton of the twist, but we're fresh out of shout
Like a death in the hall that you hear through your wall
New York, I love you, but you're freaking me out

New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down
New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down
Like a death of the heart, Jesus, where do I start?
But you're still the one pool where I'd happily drown
And, oh! Take me off your mailing list
For kids who think it still exists
Yes, for those who think it still exists
Maybe I'm wrong and maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong and maybe you're right
Maybe you're right, maybe I'm wrong
And just maybe you're right

And, oh! Maybe mother told you true
And there'll always be somebody there for you
And you'll never be alone
But maybe she's wrong and maybe I'm right
And just maybe she's wrong
Maybe she's wrong and maybe I'm right
And if so, here's this
