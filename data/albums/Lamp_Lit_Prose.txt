[Trackname: Right Now]

The sky has darkened, earth turned to hell
Some said a light got shined where darkness dwelt
So I won't cry or collapse, overwhelmed
Time like a song just might rhyme with itself

I don't know how I'm going to be a better man
I don't know how I'm going to reach the Promised Land
I don't know how I'm going to get you to take my hand
But I'm going to try and I know when

Now (now)
Right now (now)
Right now (now)
Right now (now)
Right now, now (now)
Right now, now (now)
Right now, now (now)
Right now

Soon the earth may dissolve like snow
We'll meet again in the air all bound to glow
And I am glad that I got to know
I might sing the melody
But I don't set the tempo
Who draws the true straw from the fist that's clasped?
Who pulls the new rope through the loopholes of the past?
Better hurry up for the first shall be the last
Better sound the trumpet before the blast

Now (now)
Right (now)
Now, right (now)
Now, right now (now)
Right now (now)
Now, right now (now)
Now, right now (now)
Now, right now


You pulled me up when you took my hand
There was silence in my heart
And now I'm striking up the band
They lit the bonfire but now we can light the lamp

Now (now)
Right now (now)
Right now (now)
Right now (now)
Right now, now (now)
Right now (now, now)
Right now (now, now)
Right now (now, now)
Right now (now, now)
Right now (now, now)
Right now (now)
Now, right now, now, now, now, 

[Trackname: Break-Thru]

What's up?
How's it going?
Neo real cheekbone
She is so dreamy
Like she's got features on Fellini
Deadpan, unimpressed
Archimedes Palimpsest
Just hanging out all Julian Casablancas

She is an epiphany
Her electricity opens my days like she always knew
I feel an affinity, immediately
In all the ways, she's a break-thru

Under the sun, there's nothing new
But she keeps itin the shade
She's a break-thru
It's cold out there
That's nothing new
But she keeps itthrough the shade
She's a break-thru

She is so wow
Middle-earth highbrow
Her line is Pablo but her color's Fauve
So what about it?
Just to review
She will a-break thru
Nobody stops her
No one can lock her down
She is an epiphany
Her electricity opens my days like she always knew
I feel an affinity, immediately
In all her ways, she's a break-thru

Under the sun, there's nothing new
But she keeps itin the shade
She's a break-thru
It's cold out there
That's nothing new
But she keeps itthrough the shade
She's a break-thru

She's a break-thru
She's a break-thru
She's a break-thru
She's a break-thru

Under the sun, there's nothing new
But she keeps itin the shade
She's a break-thru
It's hot out here
And warming too
But she keeps itthrough the shade
She's a break-thru
She's a break-thru
She's a break-thru
She's a break-thru
She's a break-

[Trackname: That’s A Lifestyle]

Who will stop wasting the lives of the brave
Based on a lie?
Who will stop wasting the forest and seas?
We know what will survive
Who will stop wasting the time?
Who will stop putting quarters upon on our eyes?
Who will not place himself higher than we
For a senator's prize?

We wander out wild-eyed
Kinda drunk and kinda high
We know what for and why
That's a product, that's a brand, that's a lifestyle

'Cause the monster eats its young
Till they're gone, gone, gone
And the rules are there to hurt
And that's the way it's done
Yeah, the monster eats its young
Till they're gone, gone, gone
Till it's satisfied and done
It wants blood, blood, blood
Who could look up from the numbers and say
"Something ain't right"?
Who could disrupt the abundance and pray
Not for weight but for light?
How could we risk the empire
As the apprentice descends into seasons of Idol
When our old, white Lincoln encrypted and high
Sputters down from the sky
Red-eyed in July, weeping glycol?

We shout out loud, megaphone
Kinda zoned but listening in
We browse our own episodes
That's a product, that's a brand, that's a lifestyle

'Cause the monster eats its young
Till they're gone, gone, gone
And the rules are there to hurt
And that's the way it's done
And the monster eats its young
Till they're gone, gone, gone
Till it's satisfied and done
It wants blood, blood, blood
That's a product, that's a brand, that's a lifestyle
That's a product, that's a brand, that's a lifestyle


When the predator dips out from the haze
Who knows the price?
When the words mercy and justice are raised
Members only apply
When will we count all the signs?
When will we finally not let fear weaponize?
When will the courage to breathe and let breathe
Assure the land will survive?

'Cause the monster eats its young
Till they're gone, gone, gone
And the rules are there to hurt
And that's the way it's done
Yeah, the monster eats its young
Till they're gone, gone, gone
Till it's satisfied and done
It wants blood, blood, blood
That's a product, that's a brand, that's a lifestyle
That's a product, that's a brand, that's a 

[Trackname: I Feel Energy]

Garden of flowers all bloom
When they're watered right
Laughter echoes in the room but it dies outside
Are we fundamentally alone in the universe?
What would it possibly mean if we found in each other

Something unexplained (and the feel remains lingering)
Strange lights (in the summer night sky)
Something opening (an auspicious beginning)
From the time when my eyes saw the design

I feel energy
Could this be just a tender dream?
I feel energy, yeah
I breathe, you breathe, we
I, I, I, I feel energy
I feel energy

Sometimes I get so depressed (depressed)
And I just can't move
Don't cry, they make you feel like you're dead (dead)
And it's never going to improve
But then something unexplained (and the feel remains lingering)
Perfume (in the midsummer night)
Something opening (a new consciousness beginning)
In the room when my eyes saw the design

I feel energy
Could this be just a tender dream?
I feel energy
I feel energy, yeah
I feel energy
I dream, you dream, we
I, I, I, I feel energy
I feel energy
I, I, I, I feel energy
I feel energy

What entitles you to live again?
The world's about to end
How can you pretend?
Strife and survival
We wholly depend
On our hope and love received and sent
I, I, I, I feel energy
I feel energy
I, I, I, I feel energy
I feel energy
I feel energy (I feel)
I, I, I, I feel energy
I feel, I feel
I feel energy
I feel energy
I, I, I, I feel energy
I feel energy
I feel energy
I feel energy (I feel)

I feel energy
I feel energy
I feel energy
I, I, I, I feel energy
I feel energy
I feel energy
I, I, I, I feel energy

[Trackname: Zombie Conqueror]

Crazy to feel like this
Up and down, simultaneous
Victory and defeat
One to one, we'll have to wait and see
And now the clouds are gathered
My eyes are bright, my khakis tattered

The stakes are raised
The townspeople are anxious and alert
The surface of the reservoir is mirrored and inert
The flag is hanging motionless on the pole outside the court
And in their homes the people look with stares they can't avert

Zombie conqueror
We see into the midnight in front of us
Zombie conqueror
We see into the midnight in front of us
My friend, we'll have to free each other more than once
Zombie conqueror
We see into the midnight in front of us
Night, night
I left home at fifteen
I knew no home between
Half a life goes by
Only a picture of the sky
And now the clouds are gathered
My eyes are bright, my khakis tattered

The blocking characters all plotting new disloyalty
But sensing their irrelevance, they're frowning and displeased
The car chase through the mini-mall, amaryllis on the hood
The race to clear the courthouse has been won and all is good

(Zombie conqueror)
(Zombie conqueror)
Zombie conqueror (zombie conqueror)
We see into the midnight in front of us
Zombie conqueror (zombie conqueror)
We see into the midnight in front of us
My friend, we'll have to free each other more than once
Zombie conqueror (zombie conqueror)
We see into the midnight in front of us
Night, night

[Trackname: Blue Bird]

Sky is blue, the sun shines everywhere
Breeze is blowing, messing up your hair
The Palace Versailles is nice
But if I am honest
I feel just fine on this bench with

You and me
Me and you
Something sweet
Something new
Fresh and clean
Like the beginning
Blue bird, sing your tune
From the lilacs in bloom

Walk around the city in the light
Talk about whatever's in our minds
I admit some surprise and delight
Fascinated by you
I feel lucky to get time with

You and me
Me and you
Something sweet
Something new
Fresh and clean
Like the beginning
Blue bird, sing your tune
From the lilacs in bloom
You
Fly up
To
Me like a blue bird
You
Fly up
To
Me like a blue bird
You
Fly up
To
Me like a blue bird
Fly up
To
Me like a blue bird

You and me
Me and you
Something sweet
Something new
Fresh and clean
Like the beginning
Blue bird, sing your tune
From the lilacs in bloom
You and me
Me and you
Something deep
Something true
Fresh and clean
Like the beginning
Blue bird, sing your tune
From the lilacs in bloom
You
Fly up
To
Me like a blue bird
You
Fly up
To
Me like a blue bird
You
Fly up
To
Me like a blue bird
Fly up
To
Me like a blue bird

[Trackname: I Found It In U]

Ask now, I'm in love for the first time ever
The universe becomes my mom and my dad
A hand in a glove on a joint adventure
Moving toward our own Goldilocks planet
'Cause when everyone latched like Auto-Tune
Into the grid that they all just assumed
Was and was not a map of the universe
They just misplaced the pure wave that is you

I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you

Everybody wants the same chimera
Everyone hungry but honey get off the feeds
Salt of the sea and the salt of Sierras
I preach to birds and then bees preach back to me
Now in hindsight the alienation
And all the painful dreams I failed to extinguish
Were the footlights down dark aisles I've taken
Now they've led me to you and I'm singing
I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you
I found

And when we met there were alien hosannas
Thrown from the heavens like Prince and Nirvana
Like braided brooks tied tides woven oceans
Like the trees interleaved with explosions
Of birdsong as they're singing to me
Down to earth in the land of the free
In the new time that you've given to me

I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you
I found
I found
I found
I found
I found
I found
I found
I found
I found

I (I) have (have) such a (such a) rad (rad) time with you
Any (any) thing we (thing we) do it's whatever
That's why I love you

[Trackname: What Is The Time]

Leave the spoon-fed champions
Leave the lamplit prose
Leave the endlessly distracting madness
And say hello
Hello
Hello

What is the time when I can call you by your name?
I don't know why it's been so long
Alone, imagining nobody
Once in a while, well
I guess the planets align
And show me the one I am
I am the one who would love you

Seek the dusty longshot
On the last frontier
Join the minor miracle that looks flat
But reveals itself a sphere
As the wheel of inception steers

What is the time when I can call you by your name?
I don't know why it's been so long
Alone, imagining nobody
Once in a while, well
I guess the planets align
And show me the one I am
I am the one who would love you
They say it's ashes to ashes
Passion is passing
And we all will die alone (Wow)
But while we're here on the planet
Dancing on granite
Why don't we drink Côtes du Rhône (Wow)?

What is the time when I can call you by your name?
I don't know why it's been so long
Alone, imagining nobody
Once in a while, well
I guess the planets align
And show me the one I am
I am the one who would love you

What is the time when I can call you by your name?
I don't know why it's been so long
Alone, imagining nobody
Once in a while, well
I guess the planets align
And show me the one I am
I am the one who would love you

[Trackname: You're The One]

One, two, three

Change is the only constant law
I've seen some springs and I've seen some falls
Through all the seasons I have known
In all my life, I remember the people

A wheel is in motion and spins til it's spun
'Til the earth absorbs us, laughing in flowers of sun
I choose to be yours because you're the one

Oh, high thanks I owe you, excellent
Lover and beautiful friends
Through all the memories I have been
Hoping for you to come make my world new again

I'll always have love for what came before
And with you I feel it more and more
And here with you now, I know that you're the one
And here with you now, I know that you're the one

[Trackname: (I Wanna) Feel It All]

I wanna feel it all
August's light, February's pall
Thrill to the rise and rue the fall
I wanna feel it all

I wanna feel everything
Sweetness of youth and old age's sting
Open my eyes wide and unblinking
I wanna feel everything

I wanna feel it all
I wanna feel it all

I wanna feel it all
Hand of fate and human gall
Air on the street when the rain starts to fall
I wanna feel it
Feel it all
