Shame on you
Shame on you
Hey, your love away from me
You can't hide

Hey
Your love away from me
Hey
Shame on you
Your love away from me
You can't hide
Hey
Your love away from me
Shame on you
Oh no, still you can, and I'll be lonely
Oh no, still you can, and I'll be lonely
Oh no, still you can, and I'll be lonely
Oh no, still you can, and I'll be lonely

Shame on you


My favorite song
My favorite song
Reminds me of the first time I went to space
It was such a long journey
It took hours, days, years
But when it was over...
Oh, it takes me back
That takes me back to the first time
I stepped into space
You were there
You were there with all my best friends
I remember
I remember the look on your face
The way you said, with your eyes
You said

And then I slipped out of the Sun's sphere of influence
Nothing was happening
It was so dizzying
And then you took everything from me
I was left here, a shell of my self
I was left here to pick up the pieces
And every piece was...
Love, give me love
That's when you saved me
At the last possible moment
You brought your big hand out
And scooped up my ship
And took me home
That day you gave a new faith
In how people can save one another
Instead of always putting out their hands
To crush

When you're out in space
You feel so light
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
When you're out in space
You feel so light
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
When you're out in space
You feel so light

Ready?
Ready
Welcome
Step through the doors
Sliding doors
Okay I’m serious
I’m just playing
It changed
Mystery solved
You can see everything from here
Isn't it beautiful?
It is beautiful
I bet you know what you need to know by now
Just take a moment
I must admit your technology is wonderful
I've never seen anything like this
Will you accept our friendship?
Without hesitation
I didn’t say we could promise anything more than that
Unless you’re seeing everything for the first time
Alright
That is everything
Step through the door
I have already stepped through the door
Then welcome
I see no need for this
Who's that?
I wasn't to talk to you
Who is that?
Who's talking?
I want to talk to you about a few things
Is that a voice in my head?
Help me understand why your friends are all afraid
Help me understand why your friends are all afraid
Get out of my head
They’re from New York City
By way of the interstellar highway
Doesn’t he rock you?
Thank you very much
I really appreciate it
Okay I’m done



[Trackname: Freak Out / Starry Eyes]


If we do it again, I'm gonna freak out
If we do it again, I'm gonna freak out
If we do it again, I'm gonna freak out
If we do it again, I'm gonna freak out
So do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again

Starry eyes, doot doot

Late night, miss the train
Waiting in the rain
All night on the floor
And my feet are sore

Fool's out on the make
School's out and it's late
It's you I'm waiting for
Want to see you more, see you more

Starry eyes, doot doot

Fool's out on the make
School's out and it's late
It's you I'm waiting for
Want to see you more, see you more

Uh huh
Uh huh

Starry eyes, doot doot

Bright lights in my eyes
Got me hypnotised
Late night on the floor
Wanting so much more, so much more

Starry eyes, doot doot
