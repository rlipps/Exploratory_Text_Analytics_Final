[Trackname: Who]

Who’ll be my valentine?
Who’ll lift this heavy load?
Who’ll share this taxi cab?
Who wants to climb aboard?

Who is an honest man?
Who is an honest man?

Who’ll help the tired soldier?
Far from his own hometown
Carry these men and women
Who get lost when the Sun goes down?

Who is an honest man?
Who is an honest man?

Who walks this dusty road?
Who always pulls their weight?
Who’s this?! Inside of me
Who made a big mistake
Who sees these constellations
Seen in those spinning round
Carry these men and women
Who get lost when the sun goes down?

Who is an honest man?
Who is an honest man?

With a graceful motion she sat down slowly
Drank a cup of coffee and she’ll fold her laundry
She begins to tell us all her life story
All around the table, everybody’s staring

Who shouts out hallelujah?
Who’s gonna sing out loud?
Carry these men and women
Who gets lost when the Sun goes down

Who’s getting out of here?
Who thinks they’re wide awake?
Who’s gonna be my friend
All around the table, everybody’s 

[Trackname: Weekend in the Dust]

Once so mysterious
Now decoded and used
Now according to you, you
What's so mysterious?
Once so mysterious
Now decoded and used
Now according to you, you
What's so mysterious?

Wear it well, well, you have worn it out
Give it all, well, could you give it up?
Where's the fun in holding all the cards?
Everyone gets up when you sit down

I don't get it, I just don't get it
I don't get it, I just don't
I don't get it, I just don't get it
I don't get it, I just don't
I don't get it, I just don't get it
I don't get it, I just don't
I don't get it, I just don't get it
I don't get it, I just don't
I don't get it, I just don't get it
I don't get it, I just don't
I don't get it, I just don't get it
I don't get it, I just don't
When the party's over, we can call the dog
Dare to keep our shirts on rolling in the muck
Weekend in the dust
Weak and full of blood

If you're real, I'll be a hologram
Why have none when you can have it all?

I don't get it, I just don't get it
I don't get it, I just don't
I don't get it, I just don't get it
I don't get it, I just don't

Once so mysterious
I don't get it, I just don't get it
I don't get it, I just don't
Now decoded and used
I don't get it, I just don't get it
I don't get it, I just don't
Now according to you, you
I don't get it, I just don't get it
I don't get it, I just don't
What's so mysterious?
I don't get it, I just don't get it
I don't get it, I just don't

[Trackname: Dinner for Two]

By the time the guests arrive
Ooh, already it was dark outside
Tables set with china dishes
We're welcomed in with tiny kisses
What's her name?; I don't remember
Isn't that the famous author?
Harry's gonna get some appetizers
Well, he's keeping out of range of small arms fire
Dina has a phone; she says it's working
Now she's crawling on the floor, across the kitchen

Something I should tell you
But we are never alone

Tanks outside the bedroom window
We'll be okay with the curtain closed
The guests are fine behind the sofa
It's much too late, they should not go home

Something I should tell you
But we are never alone
Up by dawn, already morning
I ask myself what is going on
Some tender words and sidelong glances
Are you okay, have you lived here long?


Underneath the stairway
Somebody's changing her clothes
Sweatpants and a t-shirt
Silk dresses cover the floor

Sit down by my side
Take my overcoat
When will we get out?
Maybe a week or soon
Some of us losing it
Some of us breaking down
Some of us stick it out
Used to it now

Something I should tell you
But we are never alone
There's something I should tell you
And I've been waiting so long

When it's over with, going our separate ways
How about you and me;
Dinner for two

[Trackname: Ice Age]

Oh, diamond, how we've been?
Oh, diamond, it's such a shame
To see you this way, freezing it out
Your own little ice age

Ice age
Ice age

Oh, diamond, get outta bed
All unbuttoned, seams are showing
And you're freaking me out, freezing it out
Your own little ice age

Ice age
Ice age
Ice age
Ice age

We won't know how much we've lost
Until the winter thaws
We won't know just what we lost
Until your winter thaws
Oh, diamond, where have you been?
It's close to your bones, it's far from your shell
So feel it away, reason it out
Your own little ice age

(Hey, hey)
Thaw me out, thaw me out
(Hey, hey)
Thaw me out, thaw me out
(Hey, hey)
Thaw me out, thaw me out
(Hey, hey

[Trackname: I Am an Ape]

In a garden stands a statue
Of the man who won the war
His expression, tender yearning
Ev'ry nation near and far

Oh sad and ancient father
Sweet as honey, tough as leather
Running down the hill on Christmas Day

I am an ape, I stand and wait
A masterpiece, a hairy beast
I move so fast, I take a chance
Then come up close
I'm not a ghost

Navigator, when you wake up
And you step outside your door
Shoes and panties washed and folded
Taking off your dirty clothes

This garden tells a story
Amber close-up, faded glory
Running through the streets on Christmas Day
I am an ape, I stand and wait
A masterpiece, a hairy beast
Try not to laugh, just take a chance
I visited
Inside your head


If you trespass in this garden
To a place you should not go
If you step out from the shadows
See the city fall in awe

I am an ape, I stand and wait
A masterpiece, a hairy beast
No need to hide, come on inside
I will not last
I too shall pass

[Trackname: The Forest Awakes]
The Forest awakes
The desert at dawn
A mountain at night
And the rhythm moves on
The people awake
They're marching along
The streets are alive with a terrible song
Forward and backwards in every direction
The atoms' perpetual motion
The shifting of light
On the banks of the river
I'm free, but I'm keeping my clothes on
I'm marching along
The street where you live
I'm calling your name
The song is a gift
The song is a road
The road is a face
A face is a time
And a time is place
A place of relief in a time of confusion
A heart is a simple equation
With beautiful words and with beautiful people
A song is a face, is a mountain
A fruit that falls before it's grown
I heard a sound and a bird has flown
It breaks to pieces above the forest
A million particles born today
Out beyond the blue horizon
Air cannot escape
Underneath the weeping willow
I can see your face
Free-form calling all over me
Creatures big and small
Doctors pulling them out of you
Hideous, virtuous, both of us
Come in my kitchen
When it rains outside
Sweet inspiration
Sneaks up from behind
The forest is true
I know for a fact
That the bigger the front
Then the bigger the back
My heart beating still
Through the perilous night
The bombs burst in the air
But my hair is alright
The shifting of light on the trees and the houses
I drowned in an ocean of perfume
The strangeness of words, how the meaning keeps changing
But somehow the beauty will find 

[Trackname: I Should Watch TV]
I used to think that I should watch TV
I used to think that it was good for me
Wanted to know what folks were thinking
To understand the land I live in
And I would lose myself
And it would set me free
This is the place where common people go
A global franchise; one department store
Yes, there were many awkward moments
I had to do some self-atonement
Well, if I opened up
Well, it would set me free
I know, I like
Behold and love this giant
Big soul, big lips
That's me and I am this
Everybody gets a touched up hairdo
Everybody's in the passing lane
Had a reason that she touched all channels
The weird things that live in there
I took a walk down to the park today
I wrote a song called "Just Like You and Me"
I heard the jokes from the sports reporter
The rival teams when they faced each other
The more I lost myself, the more it set me free
How am I not your brother?
How are you not like me?
Everybody's in the hotel lobby
I'm blending in here, yes, I am
I feel it moving in my arms and fingers
Touch me and feel my pain
It's good to lose and it's good to win sometimes
It's good to die and it's good to be alive
Maybe someday we can stand together
Not afraid of what our eyes might see
Maybe someday understand them better
The weird things inside of 

[Trackname: Lazarus]

Hey, hey, Lazarus
Workin' your backbone, swingin' your shovel
Hey, hey, Lazarus
Gold in your river, there forever

One of these days I'm gonna bring that hammer down (cool water)
I'm workin' hard, but my heart is wearing out (cool water)

Hey, hey, Lazarus
Workin' your backbone, swingin' that axe home
Hey, hey, Lazarus
Gold in your river, there forever

The captain's bell, it swings from side to side (cool water)
High on this hill, I'm working all the time (cool water)
My hammer comes down hard on ev'ryone (cool water)
I'll bring it down until my work is done (cool water)

Hey, hey, Lazarus
Water won't do, too deep was the stain
Paleolithic hunters sang this song (cool water)
To give them strength to work the whole day long (cool water)

I am the tramp slumped in your doorway
I didn't come to set you free
One of these days, when all my work is done (cool water)
I'm gonna rest in the lap of Abraham (cool water)
You will not see my face come morning
I didn't come to set you free

[Trackname: Optimist]
Waiting, but I don't mind
I'm all bus stops and heat
I'm neon in your daylight
I'm the optimist of 30th street
How it is is how it oughta to be
I've got anything but moneyed esteem
The drinks on Condé Nast
I'm the optimist of 30th street
How it is is how it oughta to be
I spy Vivian Girls on the Up, Upper East
There's no reason to be upset
There's no reason to not expect
There's no room for emptiness
No tea or sympathy
There's no room for emptiness
On a never empty 

[Trackname: Lightning]
There's a funny lightning
Threatening with striking
But it moves too quick for a picture
There's a funny lightning
'Round the corner hiding
But I'm too smart just to catch it
With gloves and rubber
So I stay put right here
Watching the sky for tears
Let the fools and cowboys roar to wrecks
But if I should wake up and find my home's in half
Who is it? Blame nature, I guess I have to laugh
And if I should wake up and find my bed has moved
Six inches, six closer to the west
But this funny lightning
I wanna invite in
If I could learn how to teach it
I salt the corners of
My room because, because
A ghost can never be too careful
And if I should wake up and find my home's in half
Who did it? Oh, nature, I hope you have a laugh
And if I should wake up and find my bed has moved
Twelve inches, twelve closer to my god
Whip crash, there's a flash and I'm back to wanting more
The crack is movin' up the wall
Whip crash, there's a flash and I'm back to wanting more
I can't help thinking this is war

[Trackname: The One Who Broke Your Heart]

All the beautiful people, they did some work on your face
And in that struggle for freedom, everyone looks the same
(That's right)
And everybody is pregnant and everybody's in pain
We're all pushin' and shovin' to make those human beings

Although they say you're aristocracy (That's what they say)
We all deserve to wear that crown

Sing along with the one who broke your heart (You know you do)
Sing aloud, it will keep you safe and warm (That's right)

Ho ho! Ho ho!

In the Garden of Eden, on a hot summer day
We were totally naked outside that small cafe
Am I the one you imagined? Am I heaven or hell?
But no one else can compare to the way you love yourself (You know you do)

I came to tell you on this bicycle
The trees and houses say hello
Sing along with the one who broke your heart (You know you do)
Sing aloud, it will keep you safe and warm (That's right)
I dreamed a dream in the middle of the night (I guess I did)
I sing along to open up those teary eyes

Faster and faster and no one's holding the wheel
Interstate highway through those cities and fields
Your friends and family, they tell your secrets to me
It's not so impressive until they all disappear

Ho ho! Ho ho! Ho ho! Ho ho!

Sing along with the one who broke your heart (You know you do)
I dreamed a dream, wake up and there you 

[Trackname: Outside of Space and Time]

My love
Your house has many rooms
The kitchen's filled with food
I'll find a place inside

The dreams that pass across your face
Come from a secret place
Everyone close your eyes

It's true
I am a shaky ladder
Intergalactic matter
Outside of space and time

But who is standing on your street
These buildings are not real
My tricks are useless here

"It's true"
That's what a lover hears
It's a what fool believes
It's not too late to try
Someday
I'll step out from the shadows
Intergalactic matter
Outside of space and time

Dirty feet
Crooked teeth
Somewhere out beyond the stars
A funny face
So lost in space
Are we?

Everyone's enlightened everyday
You may reach nirvana when you comb your hair

I know
We'll join this cosmic saga
Intergalactic matter
Where we will meet tonight
Spiraling out of sight
Outside of space and time
