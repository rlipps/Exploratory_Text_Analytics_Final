[Trackname: Daydream]
Caught up
Crack-crack!
Was it an affliction when I looked at you?
Was it an affection when I looked at you?
Or was it just a daydream?
Was it a reaction when I looked at you?
What an education! when I looked at you
Was it all a daydream?
I've never been so put off in all my life...

[Trackname: Sears Roebuck M&Ms]
Everybody says we're talkin'
About the new sweet thing
Everybody says we're talkin'
About the new sweet thing
We're hippin' on things and don't deny
We're hippin' on things and don't deny it
The new sweet thing
We're flippin' our limbs and we're ten feet high, HI-YA
We're flippin' our limbs and we're ten feet higher, HI-YA
The most sweet thing

[Trackname: Crown]
Past the breakout point we wave
Lined up toward the wind, antique
I smirk, I speak
You are a little child, you're just a little child
But I need a man
I don't boast of my collection, no I don't boast
And I see the humor in retreat
Yea I see the humor in retreat
But you are a little child, you're just a little child
And I need a man
You're good and you're kind
But I need a man

[Trackname: Aquarium]
Please, please, please
Don't you hurt my baby, please
I will sit beside you
At the bottom of the lake

[Trackname: Plain Speech]
Plain speech at the top of the red house
Plain speech, lit shoes at the courtyard
Plain speech, a pusher on a platform
Plain speech
The voice of the vendor at the bike shop
"Throw the tire on the dish"
You, you helped me onto the fixie
And you, you held your arms to the sides
And just for a moment, just for a moment
I stopped the aching muscle from to carry me away
But not with this body, not with this body
I got a date in Austin with a friend from the bay
Well it's in my nature
To sit and watch the folding bridge
Well it's in my nature
To reach my arms across the ridge
Now I know, now I know
And after I saw you by the bike shop
You touched your thumb to my cheek
And I carried, I carried back to the railing
And you, you pedaled off to the east
And just for a moment, just for a moment
I stopped the aching muscle from to carry me away
But not with this body, not with this body
I know that I am leaving but just hold me for a moment
Just for a moment (just for a moment)
Just for a moment
I stopped the aching muscle from to carry me away
But not with this body, not with this body
'Cause I know, 'cause I know

[Trackname: Electric Balloon]
(Ah-choo!)
(Bless you)
Oh, the lightning
Shock me with electric, uh...
Oh, the lightning
Shock me with electric, uh...
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Shock me with electric
Uhh, uhh
Over with the lightning
Thunderunderit
Like the lightning
Motherotherit
Oh, the lightning
Shock me with electric balloon
Oh, the lightning
Shock me with electric
(Shock me with electric balloon)
Shock me with electric
(Shock me with electric balloon)
Shock me with electric
Shock me with electric
Shock me with electric
(Shock me with electric balloon)
Shock me with electrical-uhhh
Uh, uh, uh

[Trackname: PRPL]
Don't break the pace, I'm ducking out
A flick a gem, back in the house
But so far and further
I don't know how
And so far I lead it somehow
If I'm at the point of waking ah
Only for the sake of you
A truce in play
If I'm at the point of waking ah
Only for the sake of you
A truce in play
A breath a space, I'm ducking out
Two colors and they're bleeding down
But so far and further
I don't know how
But so far and further
I don't know how
But so far and further
I don't know how
But so far and further
I don't know how
Don't break the pace, I'm ducking out
A flick a gem, back in the house
But so far and further
I don't know how
And so far I lead it somehow
But so far and further
I don't know how
But so far and further
I don't know how
But so far and further
I don't know how
But so far and further
I don't know

[Trackname: Hold U]

Hold me for a moment, baby
A yellow shape in the living room that you balance out
You set aside the ingredients as I'm coming to
And I slip into states as your hands slip beneath the dirty plates
I could spend tomorrow in two rows outside the city
And I could stack my boxes in apartments with your drawings on the wall
I could sit in reverie
But what I should do is hold you by the bottom of the hill
So hold me for a moment, baby
I was uptown in the coffee shop when I finally decided
You were dusting off the tablecloth in your parents' house
We're the same, we're the same
But I'm tired of trying to explain it
So what I should do is hold you by the bottom of the hill
So hold me for a moment, baby

[Trackname: Judy]
Could have used your advice in your absence
You were lit from below, you were vacant
Judy, I don't have the stomach for you, Judy
Move the chair from the room as you cleaned up
Did I hide by the sink as you cleaned up
Judy, I don't have the stomach for you
Did I spread my fingers for you? Or was it just my hazy memory?
Judy, Judy, my life is but a melody
Judy, you're a fallen house, and I don't want to pick you back up
Maybe I don't have the stomach for you...

[Trackname: Genesee]
Little wooded haven, safety
Rain guard lady, get up
Run around
I heard you from the shady
And I know that it's nothing, but I can't anticipate it
A swallow in the radi, but I know that it's nothing
Run around

[Trackname: Ab Ovo]
I can't anticipate if I can only see the back
I can't participate if I can only see the back
Put away, put away, put away...
I already put it away
