[Trackname: Doomscroller]

Lining up all the numbers under the names
Lining up all the numbers under the names
Notify the next of kin of the circumstances
Was it an act of God or an accident?
Act of God or an accident?

Or a consequence of a lower profile
Salt of the Earth underpaid to serve you
Salt of the Earth underpaid to serve and teach your children
Salt of the Earth underpaid to serve and scrub the toilet
Salt of the Earth underpaid to serve and scrub the toilеt ruling classes
Trickle piss from champagne glassеs
That's just how the evening passes

For a true doomscroller
And I'm a true doomscroller
I can't seem to shut it down
Until the worst is over
And it's never over

Arrogance of a coward hostile
Scum of the Earth overpaid to rob you
Scum of the Earth overpaid to rob and mock resistance
Scum of the Earth overpaid to rob anonymously from a distance
Scum of the Earth overpaid to rob anonymously ruling classes
Trickle piss from champagne glasses
History on repeat relapses
For a true doomscroller


Dog whistle links to a torch song
Torch song links to a statue burning
Moon landing links to Q Anon
Rabbit in a deep hole keep on dancing

Don't give up yet, don't give up yet
Don't give up yet, don't give up now
Don't give up yet, don't give up yet

Don't give up yet, don't give up now
Don't give up yet, don't give up yet

Don't give up yet, don't give up yet
Don't give up yet, don't give up now
Don't give up yet, don't give up yet
Don't give up yet, don't give up now
Lining up all the numbers under the names
Lining up all the numbers under the names

Boy, I'm a true doomscroller
I'm a true doomscroller
I can't seem to shut it down
Until the worst is over
And it's never over

Don't give up yet, don't give up yet
Don't give up yet, don't give up now

Don't give up yet, don't give up yet
Don't give up yet, don't give up now
Don't give up yet, don't give up yet
Don't give up yet, don't give up now
Don't give up yet, don't give up yet
Don't give up yet, don't give up now
Take something for the pain
And not something to conceal it
More like a magnification mirror full-size
Inner echo reflecting solace revived

Whatever you do
Either way we're gonna love you
Never mattered
Either way we're gonna love you
Whatever you do
Either way we're gonna love you
Never mattered
How many or how much more
You've been through

Take this for the heartache
Not some cure to negate it
More like a magnification mirror full-size
Inner reverberation happens outside

Whatever you do
Either way we're gonna love you
Never mattered
Either way we're gonna love you
Whatever you do
Either way we're gonna love you
Never mattered
How many or how much more
You've been through

Come back to yourself from the battle
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-

[Trackname: All Comes Crashing]

Starting over won't be easy, broken divided
Split tomorrow from today
Knowing what you know just makes it harder to think straight
Starting over after it breaks

Starting over when the story's got an astounding twist
You better turn that page
When push it comes to shove we do not fall out of love
We double down, we do not fade

For all I know
This might be my last night
That's how it goes, there's no one
I would rather be lying beside
When it all comes crashing
When it all comes crashing

Starting over won't be easy damage bе damned
Please say you lovе me just as I am
Starting over won't be easy misunderstand that pattern
Fear is forcing your hand
Knowing what you know just makes it harder to think straight
Starting over after it all breaks
When push it comes to shove we do not fall out of love
We double down, we do not fade

For all I know
This might be my last night
That's how it goes, there's no one
I would rather be lying beside
If all we knew
Came crashing down tonight
I'd be with you, and there's no one
I would rather be dying beside

When it all comes crashing
All comes crashing down
When it all comes crashing
All comes crashing down

We'll come crashing down together
Don't expect to live forever
We'll come crashing down together
If it all comes crashing down tonight
We'll come crashing down together
Don't expect to live forever
We'll come crashing down together
When it all comes crashing, crashing, crashing, crashing
For all I know
This might be my last night
That's how it goes, there's no one
I would rather be lying beside
If all we knew
Came crashing down tonight
I'd be with you, and there's no one
I would rather be dying beside

When it all comes crashing
When it all comes crashing
When it all comes crashing
When it all comes 

[Trackname: What Feels Like Eternity]

Crying on the line, tower under vine
Caution on repeat with nowhere to be
Surface on the peak, try a layer deep
Ready to redeem all the drudgery
Follow my pain for a long time dying
I'm crying on the line, tower under vine
Follow my pain for a long time dying
I'm crushing on repeat through another week
Toeing the line, attention to find a gate free
Pushing up to speed, cut a layer deep
Toeing the line, a tension to find a gate free
Ready to redeem all the drudgery
Drive it away and my strength might save me

It feels like eternity
For what feels like eternity
And what might overpower me
Head down, don't look up
I grind along
Feels like eternity
For what feels like eternity
To race for what's in front of me
Head down, don't look up
I sing
Shelter from the storm, keep each other warm
Who will cover me in my hour of need?
Follow my pain for a long time dying
I'm crushing on repeat through another week
Holding the light, attempting to fight the bad dream
Ready to redeem all the drudgery
Drive it away when the time lapse strikes me

It feels like eternity
For what feels like eternity
And what might overpower me
Head down, don't look up
I grind along
Feels like eternity
For what feels like eternity
To race for what's in front of me
Head down, don't look up
I sing


It feels like eternity
For what feels like eternity
And what might overpower me
Head down, don't look up
I grind along
Feels like eternity
For what feels like eternity
And what might overpower me
Head down, don't look up
I grind along
Feels like eternity
For what feels like eternity
To race for what's in front of me
Head down, don't look up
I sing along

[Trackname: Formentera]

Listen, it's hard to say
Consequence tied my tongue
Life wasn't made for one
Icons will rise and tank
Pennies in jars of clay
Heaviest fragile beast
Further ahead than me

I've got so far to go
So give my soul some peace
Suffer what it means
On some other plane
Wisdom left me blind
With nothing I could teach
The substance of my mind
The gates of shame and spite
Open to me

Over the side toss coins
Parisian fountain street
Wishes and lies compete
Moss on a rolling stone
A rising star in chains
Colder than bars of gold
Hoping the ropes will hold
Why not just let go?
The stakes are not my own
On Formentera beach
Why not walk away?
Take a sober stroll
And free my childhood dream
Before my hour is up
Time stamp my release
Today it's over

Formentera

[Trackname: Enemies of the Ocean]

Out under bright silver skies, I accept it
Quick skip to the end, let you go
Still single frames from our life
Stream before my eyes
Like a distant slideshow

How were we to know
The river ever would bend?
Split apart at the end
Enemies of the ocean

Seats on the last flight
Sunsets and moonlight
How were we to know?
Best of the first days
Christmas and birthdays
How were we to know
Thе river ever would bеnd?
Split apart at the end
Enemies of the ocean
Enemies of the ocean

In time, when the high will subside
Send in the jaws of life
Send in the jaws of life
In time, when the high will subside
Send in the jaws of life
Send in the jaws of life
Charm of the off-chance roulette
Set an opening bet so low, seemed like I'd won
Forge that signature, lack of conviction
Combined with commitment so vast
It confounds everyone

How were they to know
The river ever would bend?
Split apart at the end
Enemies of the ocean
Enemies of the ocean
Enemies of the ocean

Seats on the last flight
Sunsets and moonlight
How were we to know
The river ever would bend?
Split apart at the end
Enemies of the ocean
Enemies of the ocean
Enemies of the ocean

[Trackname: I Will Never Settle]

This is not the song
I wanted to write for you
This is not the way
I wanted to make you feel
The truth is so unkind
I can't stop the way that it sounds in your mind
It's loud and it's distorted
The longer you avoid it

Too much to settle
So I hide in my golden cage
Silence is starving
Humble pie on a paper plate
Going in circles
And my pride is the piece I hold
I will never settle
Cause to settle would crush our souls

Too much to settle
Silence is starving
I will never settle
I will never settle
Going in circles
Silence is starving
I will never settle
I will never settle
Caught a glimpse of a normal life
Terrified by the sight
We belong to another time
Dropping vanishing names we knew
But if they don't care about it
Do you still care about it?

Too much to settle
Silence is starving
I will never settle
I will never settle

(Too much to settle)
So I hide in my golden cage
(Silence is starving)
Humble pie on a paper plate
(Going in circles)
And my pride is the piece I hold
(I will never settle)
Cause to settle would crush our souls
To settle would crush our souls

We will never settle
It would crush our souls, oh, oh
We will never settle
It would crush our souls, oh, oh
(We will never settle)
(t would crush our souls, oh, oh)
(We will never settle)
(It would crush our souls, oh, oh)

[Trackname: False Dichotomy]

Told we could be who we wanted
Or get what we needed, hey yeah
One and the other competing
Over the meaning, hey yeah

Back when I said that I want it all
This wasn't the point at all
Hostile to that superficial view
Show me something that can't be bought
It's harder to do than I thought
False dichotomy, no choice to choose
When you don't know if you should fall
If there'd be a net at all
Pleasure gets so easily abused
Show me something that can't bе bought
It's harder to do than I thought
False dichotomy, no choice to choosе

Hate
Love
Hate
Love
And when you don't want to chase it
But can't stand to waste it, hey yeah
It's either rags into riches
Or life in the trenches, hey yeah

Back when I said that I want it all
This wasn't the point at all
Hostile to that superficial view
Show me something that can't be bought
It's harder to do than I thought
False dichotomy, no choice to choose
When you don't know if you should fall
If there'd be a net at all
Pleasure gets so easily abused
Show me something that can't be bought
It's harder to do than I thought
False dichotomy, no choice to choose

Hate, love (Hate, love)
Hate, love (Hate, love)
Hate, love
Hate, love
Hate, love
Hate, love

[Trackname: Oh Please]

Oh please, don't attempt to placate me
Or decide in advance how the chorus should go
Pure fear is a common theme throughline
Most don't even hope to approach the threshold
An old soul cries like a baby
I still willfully ignorant live
I paint the walls in slim shady
Hell stalls forever whatever it is
It got bad, it got so bad lately
Wildfires underperform centerfolds
To inflate exaggerate greatly
Stoke fear to drive the directionless home

I thought this was just what everyone did
I thought this was just how everyone lived
I thought this was just what everyone did
I thought this was just how everyone lived

Oh please, don't attempt to placate me
Tall Hallmark phrases that roll off the tongue
Reframe a regrettable outcome
Stimulate a forgettable doll when you're done
They're all teeth the cowardly bite me
Imitation, the worst kind of flattery
Kids in cold blood on the bullet train take me
I can kill with my eyes and I'm murdering
I thought this was just what everyone did
I thought this was just how everyone lived
I thought this was just what everyone did
I thought this was just how everyone lived

Off that axis, got here solo
Me and my reverse vertigo
Off that axis, got here solo
Me and my reverse vertigo

I thought this was just what everyone did
I thought this was just how everyone lived
I thought this was just what everyone did
I thought this was just how everyone lived

Let's go

[Trackname: Paths in the Sky]

Paths in the sky, paths in the sky
That's you and me, and we'll always be
Half hitting highs, half flying blind
Till death divides, that's you and I

In your ragged coat one boring night
You dragged me out to cure the blues
That seemed to be destroying me
Said, "Tell me all your brutal news"

At the back of the bar in the basement
By candlelight I couldn't hide
Those battles I could once survive
Now seemed to be destroying me
You shook your head, laughed when I said
"What a waste of an education"

Time flying on a path
Moving through thе sky
I don't ever want to land
Flying on a path
Moving through the sky
Thеre's no way to stop the time
Flying on a path
Moving through the sky
Play along and make it last
Flying on a path
Moving through the sky
So without you now, where would I be?
So many trials and fantasies
When I was broke you covered me
Our actions speak in a heavenly
Substitute for a conversation

Time flying on a path
Moving through the sky
I don't ever want to land
Flying on a path
Moving through the sky
There's no way to stop the time
Flying on a path
Moving through the sky
But we're doing what we can
Flying on a path
Know we're flying blind

Paths in the sky, paths in the sky
Till death divides, that's you and I
Till the stars mutate
Till a meteor hits your apartment
Sparks radiate your veins
Wearing sequined gloves
I saw the vase in the space, two faces
Took me a lifetime of contemplation
Time flying on a path
Moving through the sky
I wish I could stop the time
Flying on a path
Moving through the sky
Tried to sneak out through the back
Flying on a path
Moving through the sky
Play along and make it last
Flying on a path
Know we're flying blind
There's no way to stop the time
Flying on a path
Know we're flying blind
