[Trackname: Trials]

I met a stranger in your skin with the same eyes
I know you
With words, he had a way just like you too
Where'd you go?
I know you

I know you
I know you
I know you

Even when I’m sleeping
Even when I dream at night
You come to me
You're turning down the light
'Til you’re the only thing I see
Even when I'm sleeping
Even when I dream at night
You come to me
You're turning down the light
'Til you're the only thing I see

Look back at what you could've been every day that
I know you
Held on, but then you strayed so far from view
Couldn't say
I know you
I know you
I know you
I know you

Even when I'm sleeping
Even when I dream at night
You come to me
You’re turning down the light
’Til you're the only thing I see
Even when I’m sleeping
Even when I dream at night
You come to me
You're turning down the light
'Til you're the only thing I see

I know you

[Trackname: 8th Avenue]

Look through the eye of the needle
You have to pull at the strand
Look through the eye of the needle
Hold it in your hand

It seems that manipulation
Is the game that you play
I've got no obligation
But you live to take

Discovery
Take what you need
Discovery
Take what you need
Discovery

You walk alone in the shadows
Still you thrive in the black
The mask you wear, it fools everyone
But I watch my back

I could forget all the people
Who only misunderstand
Beyond the good or the evil
I could take a stand
Discovery
Take what you need
Discovery
Take what you need
Discovery
Take what you need
Discovery
Take what you need
Discovery

[Trackname: Spit You Out]

You open and shut your mouth
A hard thing to ignore
Your pawn, who's keeping score?
I'm right where I belong
Not wrong, but I've had doubts
I'm right where I belong

A host doesn't want you to feed
But it doesn't see
Devotion to making you weak
While they grow strong

Leech, held on, I spit you out
And cleaned you from my tongue
So long, won't turn around
Right me from your wrongs
Moved on, I shut you out
I'm right where I belong

A host doesn't want you to feed
But it doesn't see
Devotion to making you weak
While they grow strong
Break the bond
Break the bond
Break the bond
I'm glad, so glad you're gone
You're gone

A host doesn't want you to feed
But it doesn't see
Devotion to making you weak
While they grow strong

[Trackname: A Low]
Eyes like a painting
Watching
Unfading
Vacant figures
Fragment of being
Fall into pieces
Stitched together
I hit the bottom
I've got no one to talk to
Days were a problem
Guess in a way
The nights were too
I wish it were simple
It’s hard to describe the point of view
I meant to tell you
I've stumbled down into
A low
A low
A low
A low that I never thought I'd know
But I’m not complaining
You were there waiting
(Waiting for me)
Below
A low
A low
A low that I never thought I'd know
But I'm not complaining
You were there waiting
Swallowed the feeling
Good at concealing
Desperate measures
Silence between us
Down in the deepness
Thought I'd see you
I meant to tell you
I had no one to talk to
I thought I told you
I'd take you down with me too
A low
A low
A low
A low that I never thought I'd know
But I'm not complaining
You were there waiting
(Waiting for me)
Below
A low
A low
A low that I never thought I'd know
But I’m not complaining
You were there waiting
(Waiting for me)
A low
A low
A low
A low that I never thought I’d know
But I'm not complaining
You were there waiting
(Waiting for me)
Below
A low
A low
A low that I never thought I’d know
But I'm not complaining
You were there waiting
(Waiting for me)

[Trackname: No Risk]

No risk, no believing or leading
I can't ex— I can't ex— I can't exhale to breathing
In a crowded room filled with emptiness
I'm hungry but somehow I still feel refreshed
I could walk in circles for miles
Heartbeat acc— Heartbeat acc— Heartbeat accelerating
And remember I'm always second best
But I couldn't with all that weight on my chest

No risk, no believing or leading
I can't ex— I can't ex— I can't exhale to breathing
In a crowded room filled with emptiness
I'm hungry but somehow I still feel refreshed
I could walk in circles for miles
Heartbeat acc— Heartbeat acc— Heartbeat accelerating
And remember I'm always second best
But I couldn't with all that weight on my chest

No risk, no believing or leading
I can't ex— I can't ex— I can't exhale to breathing
In a crowded room filled with emptiness
I'm hungry but somehow I still feel refreshed
No risk, no risk, no risk
I still feel refreshed
No risk, no risk, no risk
That weight on my chest

[Trackname: Working It Over]

I remember everything seemed less heavy
Disorienting, think I'm running on empty
We've got gravity and that's not a lie
Got regretfulness of days gone by
There are times where I feel I'm regressing
Hard to keep on going, hard to keep stepping
I keep on laughing though I'm feeling so sad
Looking back to then, I feel so bad

Going to stay
Are you going to stay?
Can you stay with me a moment?
We've only got a moment
Going to stay
Can we live this way?
Can you stay with me a moment?
You've got to feel the gravity now

I know this storm is getting harder to weather
I'm not trying to make you feel any pressure
But things are moving fast and that's not a lie
If you're not growing, then they say you'll die
Pretty soon, think we could sail to the moon now
Oh, just think of looking down at the blue how
We could be there when the gravity dies
Hold my hand and watch the days go by
Going to stay
Can we live this way?
Can you stay with me a moment?
We've only got a moment
Going to stay
Can we live this way?
Can you stay with me a moment?
You've got to feel the gravity now

And I will do my best to keep my focus
To give you my everything
And if this mess is unfixably broken
I can't think who I'd wanna see
Someone like you standing with me
In the end

Going to stay
Can we live this way?
Can you stay with me a moment?
You've got to feel the gravity now
Going to stay
Are you going to stay?
Can you stay here in the moment?
You've got to feel the gravity now

[Trackname: A Purgatory]

Can't end, can't begin
Can't end, can't begin
The wheels keep spinning
A purgatory

Won't be your puppet
No rules or judgments
You'll master nothing
I've cut all the strings

Whispers got loud, love turned to stone
I know you know we talked about eternity and always
You were the one, sun in your eyes
I go, you go, we had begun the start of nothing

No set direction
Walked with intention
A last impression
I'm still on my feet

Whispers got loud, love turned to stone
I know you know we talked about eternity and always
You were the one, sun in your eyes
I go, you go, we had begun the start of nothing
Whispers got loud, love turned to stone
I know you know we talked about eternity and always
You were the one, sun in your eyes
I go, you go, and now we're left with nothing

[Trackname: Like I Do]
No
Nobody does it like I do
See?
Still nobody does it like I do
No, no, I do
No
Can't nobody sleep like I do
Low
Nobody goes down like I do
Keep
Sweeping all my thoughts to the side too
So
I slide through
No
Can't nobody sweep like I do
Oh
I hide too
No
Nobody as weak as I feel
'Cause I sweep
I slide
I hide too
'Cause I sweep
I slide
I had to
Turn
To all the vices I'm tied to
Leave
Leave it all to me, I'll misguide you
Oh
I had to
No
Nobody as weak as I feel
'Cause I sweep
I slide
I hide too
I hide too
'Cause I sweep
I slide
I had to
I had to

[Trackname: Masquerading]
Could we wander the city?
Let the days
Slip away
All this space
It just feels on loan
I've lost all perspective
Steering through but my grip is loose
I swear
You can feel it
No direction to get me through
I know you will feel it
It's getting to me
I try so hard to deliver
Now
I can't count my mistakes
And my back's been breaking
Bet it all looks so pretty far away
In a blaze
Hesitation all on your own
I know you can feel it
I can't wash it away
There's no winner
It's getting to me
I try so hard to deliver
Now
I can't count my mistakes
And my back's been breaking
It's getting to me
I tried and failed to deliver
Now
I can't count my mistakes
I've been masquerading

[Trackname: Honest Love]
Maybe this could all be nothing
Or am I forgetting something?
Out in the moonlight, not in the spotlight
It was a long, long time ago
I put my shoes on, they didn't fit right
But they're the only ones I own
If I could only relax, the cracks between could heal
Maybe then, the deal could change
I could hope to rejoice
But there's a few things in the way
The more that I give, I lose
When I sing all my flaws to you
Do you want an honest love?
Can we just be honest, love?
Maybe this could all be nothing
Or are you forgetting something?
Put on our fake blood, bring out the real pain
If you're set, let's let it go
Don't make it too bright, want you to sit tight
We can take this all real slow
If you're given a voice, a choice to hear the truth
Do you really want to know?
If we offer it all, I fear we'll end up on our own
Oh, it's the more that I give, I lose
When I sing all my flaws to you
Do you want an honest love?
I think I need an honest love

[Trackname: Shoulders To My Feet]
Dove in the deep end
Not just my toes in
Filled up the hole when
I'd lost control
Tend
To give myself full-send
You were a home then
You were a home then
You were a home
Shoulders to my feet
You're everything I need but
The memories keep clouding my mind
Shoulders to my feet
You're everything I need
If only I could quiet my mind
Trying to let go
Lost in a spiral
It's not what you said
No
That felt like a threat
Though
You're always ahead
One
Step to the next
One
Step to the next
One, one, one, one, one, one
Shoulders to my feet
You're everything I need but
The memories keep clouding my mind
Shoulders to my feet
You're everything I need
If only I could quiet my mind
Shoulders to my feet
You're everything I need but
The memories keep clouding my mind
Shoulders to my feet
You're everything I need
If only I could quiet my mind

[Trackname: Monolithic]

Call it a mix-up
Call it unsympathetic
Through all of the hiccups
Well, all of it felt poetic
I'd lost my rhythm
Couldn't remember my name
Call but no pickup
You were the buzz in my brain

A strong magnetic field
Monolithic in its feel
It's a strong magnetic field
In its feel

I felt you slipping
Pulled by the current, overcame
In a state of flux
I guess there's no one to blame

It's a strong magnetic field
Monolithic in its feel
It's a strong magnetic field
In its feel
