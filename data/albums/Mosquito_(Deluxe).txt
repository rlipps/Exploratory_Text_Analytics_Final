[Trackname: Subway]

I lost you on the subway car
Got caught without my metro card
I waited and I waited for the express train
Wanna catch up with you, wherever you are

I waited and I waited
I waited and I waited
I waited and I waited
I waited and I waited
And it was hot
And when it stopped
It was metal on the mental
It was somethin' in my heart
It was metal on the mental
It was somethin' in my heart
My heart

Got on the train and I took a seat
Thought, 'Why are these people all watching me?'
Caught my reflection in the subway car
Thought I'd look at you, whoever you are

I waited and I waited
I waited and I waited
I waited and I waited
I waited and I waited
And it was cool
And when it stopped
It was metal on the mental
It was somethin' in my heart
Metal on the mental
It was somethin' in my heart
Well, I got, I got, I got, I got
Got off, got off on you
Well, I got, I got
I got off, got off, got off, got off on you
Well, I got, got off, I got
Got off, got off, got off on you
I got, I got, I got
Got off, got off, got off on you

It was metal on the mental
It was somethin' in my heart
It was metal on the mental
Some somethin' in my heart

[Trackname: Area 52]

Message came from outer space
Future of the human race
Hell is not the hottest place
Let it go, shed your skin
Children never sleep again

I wanna be your passenger
Take me as your prisoner
I want to be an alien
Take me please, oh alien
I wanna be an alien
Take me

Yo' instruments can't stop our ships
Soon you'll be our guinea pigs
The rest will all be blown to bits
Let it go, you had your day
Spaceman take your kids away

I wanna be your passenger
Take me as your prisoner
I want to be an alien
Take me please, oh alien
I wanna be an alien
Take me please, oh alien
You must taste our violent fuzz
Your wars are of no use to us
You cannot fix what never was
Let it go, had your day
The meteor is on its way

I wanna be your passenger
Take me as your prisoner
I want to be an alien
Take me please, oh alien
I wanna be an alien
Take me please, oh alien

Prognostic figure of speech to manifesto
Dr. Octagon move in the dark though
Multiply darkness, I'm the bright artist
Hologram image on the interface
Manage the code to bury them alive
Manage the code to bury them inside
Show smoke from the smoke machine
Lights on the top flash purple and green
Purple and mean, rise with the vampires
Look over skies from a high-rise
Doc Oc operate by the clock
Medicine bag come down by your block
Raise the dead, hypnotize with your head
Chemical react surgery to your head
Eyeballs up all night turn red
Free yourself, that leash is long, long, long
Free yourself, that leash is long, long, long
Free yourself, that leash is long, long, long
Free yourself, that leash is long, long, long
I was buried alive, I was buried alive, I was buried alive

With every breath I breathe
I'm making history
With your name on my lips
The ages fall to bits
In flames I sleep soundly
With angels around me
I lay at your feet
You're the breath that I breathe
Some kind of violent bliss
Led me to love like this
One thousand deaths my dear
I'm dying without you here
In flames I sleep soundly
With angels around me
I lay at your feet
You're the breath that I breathe
You're the breath that I breathe
The breath that I breathe
The breath that I breathe
You're the breath that I breathe
The breath that I breathe
