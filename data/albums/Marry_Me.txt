[Trackname: Jesus Saves, I Spend]

While Jesus is saving, I'm spending all my days
In backgrounds and landscapes with the languages of saints
While people are spinning like toys on Christmas Day
I'm inside a still life with the other absentee

While Jesus is saving, I'm spending all my days
In the garden-grey pallor of lines across your face
While people will cheer on the spectacle we've made
I'm sitting and sculpting menageries of saints

Oh, my man, my absentee
I'd do anything to please you
Come, my love, the stage is waiting
Be the one to save my saving grace

While Jesus is saving, I'm spending all my grace
On the rosy-red pallor of lights on center stage
While people have cheered on the awful mess we've made
Through storms of red roses, we've exited the stage

[Trackname: Your Lips Are Red]

Your lips are red
My face is red from reading your red lips
My hands are black
My hands are black inside this downtown taxi cab
This city's red
This city's red from riding us into the ground
This city's black
This city's black from all the ashes in downtown
(Ashes in downtown, ashes in downtown)

My face is drawn
My face is drawn on with this number 2 pencil
Your face is drawn
Your face is drawn from drawing words right from my lips
(Words right from my lips, words right from my lips)

Your lips are red
My face is red from reading your red lips
My hands are red
My hands are red from sealing your red lips
(Sealing your red lips, sealing your red lips)

Your skin's so fair
Your skin's so fair, it's not fair
Your skin's so fair
Your skin's so fair, it's not fair
Your skin's so fair
(You remind me)
Your skin's so fair, it's not fair
Your skin's so fair

Your skin's so fair, it's not fair

Your skin's so fair, it's not fair

Oh

[Trackname: Marry Me]

Marry me, John, marry me, John
I'll be so good to you
You won't realize I'm gone
Marry me, John, marry me, John
I'll be so sweet to you
You won't realize I'm gone
You won't realize I'm gone

Many people wanna make money, make love
Make friends, make peace with death
But most mainly wanna win the game
They came to win, they want to come out ahead
But you, you're a rock with a heart
Like a socket I can plug into at will
And will you guess when I come around next?
I hope your open sign is blinking still

So marry me, John, marry me, John
I'll be so good to you
You won't realize I'm gone
Marry me, John, marry me, John
I'll be so good to you
You won't realize I'm gone
You won't realize I've gone
As for me, I would have to agree
I'm as fickle as a paper doll
Being kicked by the wind
When I touch down again
I'll be in someone else's arms

Oh, John, come on
We'll do what married people do
Oh, John, come on
(I don't care what you are)
Let's do what Mary and Joseph did
(I want to marry you)
Without the kid
(I want to marry you)

So marry me, John, marry me, John
I'll be so good to you
You won't realize I've gone
Marry me, John, marry me, John
I'll be so good to you
You won't realize I've gone
You won't realize I've gone
You won't realize I've gone
You won't realize I've gone
You won't realize I've gone
You won't realize I've gone
Many people wanna make money, make love
(Marry me, John)
Make friends, make peace with death
(Marry me, John)
Many people wanna make money, make love
(Marry me, John)
Make friends, make peace with death
(Marry me, John)
Many people wanna make money, make love
(Marry me, John)
Make friends, make peace with death
(Marry me, John)
Many people wanna make money, make love
(Marry me, John)
Make friends, make peace with death

[Trackname: Paris Is Burning]

I write to give word the war is over
Send my cinders home to mother
They gave me a medal for my valor
Leaden trumpets spit the soot of power

They say, "I'm on your side when nobody is, 'cause nobody is
Come sit right here and sleep while I slip poison in your ear."

We are waiting on a telegram to give us news of the fall
I am sorry to report, dear Paris is burning after all
We have taken to the streets in open rejoice, revolting
We are dancing a black waltz, fair Paris is burning after all

Oh no

Enclosed in this letter, there's a picture
Black and white for your refrigerator
Sticks and stones have made me smarter
It's words that cut me under my armor

They say, "I'm on your side when nobody is, 'cause nobody is
Come sit right here and sleep while I slip poison in your ear."
We are waiting on a telegram to give us news of the fall
I am sorry to report, dear Paris is burning after all
We have taken to the streets in open rejoice, revolting
We are dancing a black waltz, fair Paris is burning after all

Oh no, ooh

Dance, poor people, dance and drown
Dance fair Paris to the ground
Dance, poor people, dance and drown
Dance fair Paris, ashes now
Dance, poor people, dance and drown
Dance fair Paris to the ground
Dance, poor people, dance and drown
Dance fair Paris, ashes now
Dance, poor people, dance and drown
Dance fair Paris to the ground
Dance, poor people, dance and drown
Dance fair Paris, ashes 

[Trackname: All My Stars Aligned]

I read the signs
I got all my stars aligned
My amulets, my charms
I set all my false alarms
So I'll be someone who won't be forgotten
I've got a question and you've got the answer

I do a dance to make the rain come
Smile to keep the sky from falling down, down, down, down
Collect the love that I've been given
Build a nest for us to sleep in here
You know it's real

I check my palms
The cracks in the sidewalk
My visions and my dreams
I cross all my fingers
That you'll be someone who won't be forgotten
What was your question?
I've got the answer

I do a dance to make the rain come
Smile to keep the sky from falling down, down, down, down
Collect the love that I've been given
Build a nest for us to sleep in here
You know it's real
There are no signs
There are no stars aligned
No amulets, not a charm
To bring you back to my arms
There's just this human heart that's built with this human flaw
What was your question?
Love is the answer

I do a dance to make the rain come
Smile to keep the sky from falling down, down, down, down
Collect the love that I've been given
Build a nest for us to sleep in here
You know it's 

[Trackname: The Apocalypse Song]

Wait, I'll be swifter than the speed of light
Carbon all my body, a billion years of time
You'll wake with the stitches over both your eyes
And deny me my body and all earthly delights

It's time, you are light
I guess you are afraid of what everyone is made of
Time and light
I guess you are afraid of what everyone is made of

All of your praying amounts to just one breath
Please keep your victory, but give me little death

It's time, you are light
I guess you are afraid of what everyone is made of
Time and light
I guess you are afraid of what everyone is made of

Time, time, time, time

Time, you are light
I guess you are afraid of what everyone is made of
Time and light
I guess you are afraid of what everyone is made of
Everyone is made of
So take to the streets with apocalypse refrain
Your devotion has the look of a lunatic's 

[Trackname: Landmines]

I'm crawling through landmines
Just to know where you are
There's smoke in my eyes
'Cause you're burning the ground
I'm crawling through landmines
Just to feel where you are
Under cover of night
I put a pearl in the ground

Where'd you go?
(Not so far)
Please don't go
(Not too far)
Where'd you go?
(Not so far)
Please don't go
(Not too far)

I found your ring with the feather on
One arm in and one arm gone
Save this ring, let's bring Paris right here

Oh, my dear
My love
Do you know, my love?
Do you know?
I'm crawling through landmines
Just to feel where you've been
There's gauze over my eyes
But you're leaving this trail
I'm crawling through landmines
I know 'cause I planted them
Under cover of night
I put my heart in the ground

Oh, where'd you go?
(Not so far)
Please don't go
(Not too far)
Where'd you go?
(Not so far)
Please don't go
(Not too far)

I found your glove with the leather torn
Five fingers that I'm counting on
Smoke signals to call you right here

Oh, my love
My dear
My love
My dear
My love
My dear
My love
My dear
My love
My 

[Trackname: Human Racing]

Romeo, where'd you go?
It's been years and still no sign but I'm keeping hope alive
Juliet, how you been?
You look like death, like you sure could use some rest from this place, human racing and the faces of people who pound at your door
They'll always want more, they'll want more

Hummingbird, what's the word?
Are you still your mother's child or have you found yourself a flower?
Flower child, you're still wild
Under a harvest moon, can we eat of all the fruits of our youth?
Tell the truth now
Your heart is a strange little orange to peel
What's the deal?
What's the deal?

Mary, dear, how you feel?
Are you lost without your lamb?
You know I think I understand
Little lamb, what's your plan?
Greener pastures in the sky?
It's a shame you want to die, know why?
Just to find you've been blinded to the greenest of pastures
They're right here on Earth
For what it's worth, you're not...
...the first to break my heart
You're not the first to break my heart
You're not the first to break my heart
You're not the first to break my heart
You're not the first to break my heart

[Trackname: What Me Worry]

What, me worry?
I never do
I'm always amused
And amusing you
Sans le fear of impending doom
Life is like banquet food
Pleasure to peruse

Do I amuse you, dear?
Would you think me queer
If while standing beside you
I opted instead to disappear?
Disappear

In no hurry
I'll sing my tune
All my skies the hue
Of a ruddy bruise
In my finest threads couture
I'll call up my favorite muse
For a drink—half full—or two

Have I abused you, dear?
You have had it to here
You say, "Love is just a blood match to see who endures lash
After lash
With panache."
In the spring, I dust off my lute
Stuff my suitcase full of blues
And I'll stir the dust underneath
The thrust of my clicking heels
C'est la vie

What, me worry?
I never do
Life is one charming ruse
For us lucky few

Have I fooled you, dear?
The time, it's coming near
When I'll give you my hand and I'll say, "It's been grand
But, I'm out of here."
I'm out of
