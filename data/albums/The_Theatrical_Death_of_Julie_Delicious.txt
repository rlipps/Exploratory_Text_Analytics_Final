[Trackname: Over You]

Yeah, turn it up

I'm a bitch, modern witch
I'm a student in the failure of love
And it hurt, and it burned
But the angels sing to me from above
(And the angels sing)

Come on, girl, your life just started
Don't waste time so broken-hearted
If it's done then he's not the one
(He's not the one)
Once upon a time, you parted
Soon, you'll know the ancient garden
You're a flower, you are the sun

I'm so hopeless and over you
Think that you know it too, ooh

I'm a fool, precious jewel
I'm a mountain range that you'll never see
And I try not to cry
Do you know how much your love meant to me?
(To me, to me, to me)
(And the angels sing)
Come on, girl, your life just started
Don't waste time so broken-hearted
If it's done then he's not the one
(He's not the one)
Once upon a time, you parted
Soon, you'll know the ancient garden
You're a flower, you are the the sun
You're the sun!

I'm so hopeless and over you
Think that you know it too, ooh
I'm so hopeless and over you
Want you to know it too, ooh

I say that it's over
But here, I'm still singing
I'm hoping the future
Will bring me some meaning
I say that it's over
But here, I'm still singing
I'm hoping the future
Will bring me some meaning
I'm so hopeless and over you
Think that you know it too, ooh
I'm so hopeless and over you
Want you to know it too, ooh

I say that it's over
But here, I'm still singing
I'm hoping the future
Will bring me some meaning
I said that it's over
But here, I'm still singing
(I'm so hopeless and over you)
I'm hoping the future
(Want you to know it too, ooh)
Will bring me some 

[Trackname: Number One]
Everybody's so new
Everybody's so new
I forgot about you
I forgot about you
That's what I'm told to do
(To forget about you
To forget about...)
Everybody's so new
Everybody's so new
I can't remember what's true
Can't remember what's true
That's what I'm told to do
(To forget about you
To forget about...)
I know it's not for me but I can't go
Anyone's number one if you say so
Yet for now, can't we live above?
'Cause for now, everyone's so fucked
Oh the world is so cruel
Oh the world is so cruel
They only talk about the fool
They only talk about the fool
That's what they're told to do
(Only talk about fool
Only talk about...)
What if I told you I'm through?
What if I told you I'm through?
We never talk about the truth
Never talk about the truth
That's what we're told to do
(Never talk about truth
Never talk about...)
I know it's not for me but I can't go
Anyone's number one if you say so
Yet for now, can't we live above?
'Cause for now, everyone's so...
I know it's not for me but I can't go
Anyone's number one if you say so
Yet for now, can't we live above?
'Cause for now, everyone's so fucked
Get it, get it, get it, everybody's dying either way
Breathing but not feeling, is it even living anyway?
I'm trying not to notice all the things you've put inside my head
I'd rather dance in front of mirrors and jump on top of a hotel bed
Tell me, tell me, tell me, is the passion dying every day?
When you find me bleeding, are you happy 'cause you got your way?
I'm living in the moment or the future or the past, for now
I'd rather run away forever but I really just don't know how
I know it's not for me but I can't go
Anyone's number one if you say so
Yet for now, can't we live above?
'Cause for now, everyone's so...
I know it's not for me but I can't go
Anyone's number one if you say so
Yet for now, can't we live above?
'Cause for now, everyone's so 

[Trackname: Hundred Thousand Hearts]

Wake me in the morning I'm afraid
I don't want to go to sleep and see your face
I need you more than I should ever say
What about you? What about you?
The stars are always taunting me at night
Remind me that I'm not the only life
Sometimes I don't wanna know they're right
What about you? What about you?
While humanity's begging to end
As eternity's starting again
I'll be hanging on all that you said
I just can't believe it

I don't wanna hear you say
You don't love me anyway
After all I do, I do it for you
I don't wanna hear you say
I don't love you anyway
After all I do, I do it all for you

A million years won't dry away my eyes
A hundred thousand hearts will know my cry
Romantic for the sake of my demise
What about you? What about you?
When the cosmos holds everything dead
When the oceans have leveled my bed
I'll be hanging on all that you said
I hope you believe it, yeah

I don't wanna hear you say
You don't love me anyway
After all I do, I do it for you
I don't wanna hear you say
I don't love you anyway
After all I do, I do it all for you

Oh, it's you and me every time I dream
Let me take you everywhere I go
We can skip this town, get away for now
I want a wedding like a Broadway show
With a fountain made of chocolate, looking famous
And our statues made of gold, how could you blame us?
Is it love you need? Does your heart not bleed?
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon let me know
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon let me know
I don't wanna hear you say
You don't love me anyway
After all I do, I do it for you
I don't wanna hear you say
I don't love you anyway
After all I do, I do it all for you
I don't wanna hear you say
You don't love me anyway
After all I do, I do it for you
I don't wanna hear you say
I don't love you anyway
After all I dooo-oh-oh

Na na na na na na na na forever yours, forever yours, oh oh
Na na na na na na na na you, you

[Trackname: Raining Romance]

Stop it, hate it, judge it
Let 'em all know
Baby you're above it
Look at your gold
Wonder, whisper, fuck it
I think you should know
(It's you, it's you, it's you, it's you)

Try it, taste it, change it
Don't let it go
All your friends are famous
You told me so
Maybe you're the danger
Oh, you gotta know

I just wanna live forever, baby
Bury me inside the saddest movie

It's all raining romance with you (With you! With you!)
It's all raining romance with you (With you! With you!)
Take me, make me, shape me
I'm dying to know
Feel it, wish it, want it
On top of the world
C'mon, let's be honest
We're here for the show
(It's you, it's you, it's you, it's you)

I just wanna live forever, baby
Bury me inside the saddest movie

It's all raining romance with you (With you! With you!)
It's all raining romance with you (With you! With you!)

[Trackname: Haunt Me In The Night]

Sometimes when I'm alone I feel someone next to me
And one time when I got home, they moved all my groceries
Dark in the night I'll open up my eyes and see
Stark in the moonlight, something floating in front of me
But you don't have to worry, these angels keep me safe
Like when I tried to end my life, they wouldn't allow that fate
I cried as I drove home that day, I thought it all would break
Luckily the winter only leads to flowers in the spring

I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is about you
But I don't wanna live
No, I don't wanna live
No, I don't wanna live without you
Every time I close my eyes
I know that you and I will never die

Inside my dreams I see you, we're on a picnic date
Claire, Wanda, Anna, Nonna, I so appreciate
If I should ever lose my way I pray you'll guide me home
Sometimes all you really need is light to prove the path is shown
I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is about you
But I don't wanna live
No, I don't wanna live
No, I don't wanna live without you
Every time I close my eyes
I know that you and I will never die
I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is about you
But I don't wanna live
No, I don't wanna live
No, I don't wanna live without you
Every time I turn around
I know you'll always haunt me in the night

I'm a ghost that's living
I'm a ghost that's living
Inside of my dreams
In my dreams
Baby, don't you wake me
Don't you wake me
This reality is mine
I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is about you
But I don't wanna live
No, I don't wanna live
No, I don't wanna live without you
Every time I close my eyes
I know that you and I will never die
I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is about you
But I don't wanna live
No, I don't wanna live
No, I don't wanna live without you
Every time I turn around
I know you'll always haunt me in the night

Every time I close my eyes
I know that you and I will never die
Every time I turn around
I know you'll always haunt me in the 

[Trackname: Carmelo]

Don't keep me any longer, I can't hold my breath
It's cold beneath the water but I understand
At least we had a story, wasn't that the plan?
I always wear your sweater, please don't hold my hand
So can we call it over if I'm still beneath
The weight of primavera when you finally sneaked
Into my little bedroom when I had to pee
At least you said goodbye

Take me out tonight
I really want to know that it's alright
That maybe we could talk, I'll buy your flight
Don't tell me no

What if we had it all?
I think we're better than this
You changed it all, it's not your fault
You changed it all, it's not your fault
(It's not your fault)

I danced upon your table to your quiet laugh
You called me Miss America when you would pass
You're still beneath the pear tree every time I dream
Ognuno volará
Take me out tonight
I really want to know that it's alright
That maybe we could talk, I'll buy your flight
Don't tell me no

What if we had it all?
I think we're better than this
You changed it all, it's not your fault
You changed it all, it's not your fault
(It's not your fault)

I can't hide all the utter pain
I'm probably much too ashamed
I can't think of saying your name, I, I, I, I
I honestly feel I've not changed
I know when we met it was fate
I hope that you'll hold me again, I, I, I, I

What if we had it all?
I think we're better than this
You changed it all, it's not your fault
You changed it all, it's not your fault
(It's not your fault)
What if we had it all?
I think we're better than this
You changed it all, it's not your fault
You changed it all, it's not your fault

[Trackname: Fight For Me]

If I met you on the way back
Coming from a space craft
Would you tell me that you think I'm pretty?
If we met when we were in high school
Would your nerves reveal you
Sweaty palms that hold me on our prom night?

Oh, I believe
My destiny leads me back to you
In every lifetime

Why didn't you fight for me?
How could you just let me leave?
I'd been waiting all my life to find you
Why didn't you fight for me?
How could you just let me leave?
Now I have to die again to find you

If we were living in the 80s
Feathered hair and lazy
Would your metal band write songs about me?
What if we were both much older
Life had turned you colder
Would my voice melt all your cynicism?
Oh, I believe
My destiny leads me back to you
In every lifetime

Why didn't you fight for me?
How could you just let me leave?
I'd been waiting all my life to find you
Why didn't you fight for me?
How could you just let me leave?
Now I have to die again to find you
 Hi, moon?
Hi, sun
Does it really have to be over?
If we had it once, it won't ever go away

Now the sun is setting down
The moon'll come around
The palest light, I know it shines on you
At least we have the stars
No matter where we are
'Cause somewhere out there you and I are true
Why didn't you fight for me?
How could you just let me leave?
I'd been waiting all my life to find you
Why didn't you fight for me?
How could you just let me leave?
Now I have to die again to find you

[Trackname: Patron Saint]

Hey you, you're standing in my way
A solid obstacle you make
I want an answer or at least the truth
I try to please you every day
But still it's all that you can say
You want a hit 'cause you don't want to lose
And as you scream the words out loud
You're trying hard to force a crowd
And you should slice me 'cause I'm just your meat
You could sell me at your store
But you don't want to anymore
I am your used Thanksgiving Day Parade float

Oh-whoa I gotta stop
Living like I'm not
Yeah you said that you believed in me, but baby I don't know
Oh-whoa I gotta stop
Pushing it to pop
I don't care about the label 'cause it doesn't mean a lot

Maybe the times have never changed
I'm just a puppet in your game
You're not my Patron Saint if I say so
You can't control me with your words
Despite you're using them like swords
I can't believe I let you get this close
Oh-whoa I gotta stop
Living like I'm not
Yeah you said that you believed in me, but baby I don't know
Oh-whoa I gotta stop
Pushing it to pop
I don't care about the label 'cause it doesn't mean a lot

Now I see I let you down
But you still won't let me out
Yeah you told me that you needed me, it really doesn't show
Oh-whoa I gotta stop
Living like I'm not
Yeah you said that you believed in me, but baby I don't know

I am last season's mannequin
No longer cute and in fashion
I am the Christmas song that you don't know
I am the summer at the shore
You don't remember anymore
I am the novel that you wish you wrote

Oh-whoa I gotta stop
Living like I'm not
Yeah you said that you believed in me, but baby I don't know
Oh-whoa I gotta stop
Pushing it to pop
I don't care about the label 'cause it doesn't mean a lot
Now I see I let you down
But you still won't let me out
Yeah you told me that you needed me, it really doesn't show
Oh-whoa I gotta stop
Living like I'm not
Yeah you said that you believed in me, but baby I don't know

Now I see I let you down
But you still won't let me out
Yeah you told me that you needed me, it really doesn't show
Oh-whoa I gotta stop
Living like I'm not
Yeah you said that you believed in me, but baby I don't 

[Trackname: Saturday]

Once upon an orange grove
Where bodies never held their consistence, at night
That's when everything was really, alright
Never had to understand the silly laws
We saw and gravity wouldn't ever fall
There the future and the past
Have always been intrinsically mended, alright
Doesn't matter if it's dark or, it's light
Every feeling that you had or ever would
It lived inside you as you know it should (one, two, three)

Maybe on a Saturday
Tell me can I see you again? Ooh-whoa
I'm just here waiting for you
Come on, you know that it's true
One million butterflies are next to me
Oh, you know that I can't pretend, no
I'm just here waiting for you
Come on, you know that it's true

Now we're here on earth
The other planets only mock our existence, ya know
Yeah, they pull upon the human, ego
Don't you wish that every dream you ever conjured up
Delivered you from evil, but
Saturn's lying next to us
He's laughing, teasing, "This is your lesson", okay
"Don't believe all of the worst of, your days
"Every time you think of dying you should wait
Because the romance might be here to stay"
Maybe on a Saturday
Tell me can I see you again? Ooh-whoa
I'm just here waiting for you
Come on, you know that it's true
One million butterflies are next to me
Oh, you know that I can't pretend, no
I'm just here waiting for you
Come on, you know that it's true

(Take it away, Louie)

Maybe on a Saturday
Tell me can I see you again? Ooh-whoa
I'm just here waiting for you
Come on, you know that it's true
One million butterflies are next to me
Oh, you know that I can't pretend, no
I'm just here waiting for you
Come on, you know that it's true

Maybe on a Saturday
Tell me can I see you again? Ooh-whoa
I'm just here waiting for you
Come on, you know that it's true
You know that it's true
One million butterflies are next to me
Oh, you know that I can't pretend, no
I'm just here waiting for you
Come on, you know that it's true

[Trackname: Wishing You Away]

I wonder if I even look like you
My horoscope told me not to feel blue
What's the point of all of these love songs?
You've replaced me now, let me you too
I was in 5th grade, where is your shame?
The Beastie Boys didn't own their own airplane
Do you recognize your own daughter?
Is your life much better without her?

I keep wishing you away
Wishing you away
Wishing you away
Wishing you away
Wishing you away
Still I'm wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay

I had had a dream that you were dead
And I woke up crying in my head
It made no sense 'cause I don't know you
But it felt like everything was true
I keep wishing you away
Wishing you away
Wishing you away
Wishing you away
Wishing you away
Still I'm wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay

I keep wishing you away

Still I'm wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay

Oh, I'm still scared of all of you
And I don't know what you might do
Won't you let me meet my brother?
And do you like to hit my mother?
Toby said you denied me
Is your life just like a movie?
Won't you let me meet my brother?
And we can hide it from my mother
I keep wishing you away
Wishing you away
Wishing you away
Wishing you away
Wishing you away
Still I'm wishing you would stay
Wishing you would stay
