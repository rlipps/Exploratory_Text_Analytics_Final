[Trackname: 2 + 2 = 5]

We're on, that's a nice way to start, Jonny

Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always makes a five

I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April showers
And two and two always makes a five

It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now
Because

You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention

Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been

I try to sing along
But I get it all wrong
'Cause I'm not, 'cause I'm not
I swat 'em like flies
But like flies, the bugs keep coming back
Not, but I'm not
All hail to the thief
All hail to the thief
But I'm not, but I'm not
But I'm not, but I'm not
Don't question my authority or put me in a box
'Cause I'm not, 'cause I'm not
Oh, go and tell the king
That the sky is falling in
But it's not, but it's not, but it's not
Maybe not, maybe

Sit down, stand up
Sit down, stand up

Walk into the jaws of hell (Sit down)
Walk into the jaws of hell (Stand up)

Hey, we can wipe you out anytime (Stand up)

[Trackname: Sail To The Moon]

I sucked the moon
I spoke too soon
And how much did it cost?
I was dropped from moonbeams
And sailed on shootin' stars

Maybe you'll be president
But know right from wrong
Or in the flood you'll build an ark
And sail us to the moon

Sail us to (to) the moon
Sail 

[Trackname: Backdrifts]

We're rotten fruit, we're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifting

This far, but no further
I'm hanging off a branch
I'm teetering on the brink of
Honey sweets, so full of sleep
I'm backsliding

You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do

All evidence has been buried
All tapes have been erased
But your footsteps give you away
So you're backtracking

Ah-ah-ah
You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do
You fell into our, you fell into our...

We're rotten fruit, we're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're 

[Trackname: Go To Sleep]

Something for the rag and bone man
Over my dead body
Something big is gonna happen
Over my dead body

Someone's son or someone's daughter
Over my dead body
This is how I end up sucked in
Over my dead body

I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me

We don't really want a monster taking over
Tiptoe 'round, tie him down
We don't want the loonies taking over
Tiptoe 'round, tie him down

May pretty horses
Come to you as you sleep
I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over 

[Trackname: Where I End and You Begin]

There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin

Four, five, six, seven

I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't, and I can't come down
I can watch but not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone

X will mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling in the sea
In the sea
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you 

[Trackname: We Suck Young Blood]

Are you hungry, are you sick?
Are you begging for a break?
Are you sweet, are you fresh?
Are you strung up by the wrists?

We want the young blood
Are you fracturing?
Are you torn at the seams?
Would you do anything?
Flea-bitten, moth eaten?

We suck young blood
We suck young blood

Won't let the creeping ivy
Won't let the nervous bury me
Our veins are thin
Our rivers poisoned

We want the sweet meats
We want the young 

[Trackname: The Gloaming]

Genie let out of the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Genie let out of the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Murderers, you're murderers
We are not the same as you
Genie let out of the bottle
Funny, ha-ha, funny how

When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing
When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing
With your breathing

They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
To the shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm bells
Shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing

They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
This is the 

[Trackname: There, There]

In pitch dark
I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches
Trip me as I speak

Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there

There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck
(Ooh-ah, don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Ooh-ah, don't reach out, don't reach out)
Steer away from these rocks
We'd be a walking disaster
(Ooh-ah, don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Ooh-ah, don't reach out, don't reach out)

Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder)
(Someone on your shoulder)
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder)
(Someone on your shoulder)
There, there

Why so green and lonely, and lonely
And lonely?
Heaven sent you to me, to me
To me
We are accidents waiting, waiting
To happen
We are accidents waiting, waiting
To 

[Trackname: I Will]

I will lay me down
In a bunker underground
I won't let this happen to my children
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
With white elephants, sitting ducks
I will rise up

Little baby's eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes, eyes 

[Trackname: A Punch Up at a Wedding]

No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no

I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you
I was there, it wasn't like that
You've come here just to start a fight

You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punch-up at a wedding, yeah

Hypocrite, opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn 'round, you stay frozen to the spot
The pointless snide remarks
Of hammerheaded sharks
The pot will call the kettle black
It's a drunken punch-up at a wedding, yeah

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, 

[Trackname: Myxomatosis]

The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his newfound friends
He said, I been where I liked
I slept with who I like
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now

I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied

I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied
Don't know why I
Feel so skinned alive
My thoughts are misguided and a little na√Øve
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
Yeah, no one likes a smartass, but we all like stars
Wait, that wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up, strangled, beaten up
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis

I don't know why I
Feel so tongue 

[Trackname: Scatterbrain]

I'm walking out in a force ten gale
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails
Your voice is rapping on my windowsill

Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind
Yesterday's people end up scatterbrain there
Any fool can easy pick a hole, I only wish I could fall in
A moving target in a firing range

Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Lightning fuse, powercut


[Trackname: A Wolf At the Door]

Drag him out your window
Dragging out the dead
Singing "I miss you"
Snakes and ladders
Flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knifes you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Get up, get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance, you fucker, dance, you fucker
Don't you dare, don't you dare
Don't you, flan in the face
Take it with the love it's given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the taxman
Let me back, let me back
I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror
At the face you don't recognize
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside
I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up
Calls me on the phone, tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops

No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no

Walking like giant cranes and
With my X-ray eyes, I strip you naked
In a tight little world and are you on the list?
Stepford wives, who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers, investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and Sunday papers
City boys in first class
Don't know we're born at all
Just know someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Someone always does
Oh, I wish you'd get up
Get over, get up, get over, turn your tape off
I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up
Calls me on the phone, tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
So I'm just gonna...
