[Trackname: Offering]

No I can't see, not yet
But it's so real to me
Promise to try to forget
If you're not hearing me
Up to my eyes in my dust
And would you shed a tear for me
Know that you're trying, yes
But you're not saving anything

Hanging at the end of a rope
But I can make you an offering
Such a terrifying joke
But I can make you an offering

Know that this might be a test
But it's so real to me
So hard to keep you impressed
When you're not clear with me
Secrets kept close to your chest
Well that's not how it has to be
Now that we used to impress
And you ignore most everything
Hanging at the end of a rope
But I can make you an offering
Such a terrifying joke
But I can make you an offering

(Give back to) The one who first gave you
(Give back to) The one that you know
(Give back to) The one who forgave you
(Give back to) Who showed you love

Hanging at the end of a rope
But I can make you an offering
Such a terrifying joke
But I can make you an 

[Trackname: I Took Your Picture]

I took your picture
I felt my heartbeat slow down
It's hard to miss you
'Cause you're the one thing moving in the background

I bite my tongue shut all through the thick of it
My lips are numb, when I choke my teeth will fit
I've got this problem and I'm trying to tell you
I watch the photographs fading away

Close to someone's reject
Long play is the enemy
Close to someone's reject
Hope it's not the end of me

Tinge of blue (Close to someone's reject)
To the end (Long play is the enemy)
Left our hearts (Close to someone's reject)
With regret, I'm learning

I took your picture
I saw the light shine on you
But I can't fix it
Think I knew by now it's all that we do
I'm running out of ways to get to the truth of it
Our time is nothing and it slips through our fingertips
I saw it coming and I tried to tell you
I took the photograph and threw it away

Close to someone's reject
Long play is the enemy
Close to someone's reject
Hope it's not the end of me
Close to someone's reject
Long play is the enemy
Close to someone's reject

Tinge of blue (Close to someone's reject)
To the end (Long play is the enemy)
Left our hearts (Close to someone's reject)
With regret, I'm learning
Tinge of blue (Close to someone's reject)
To the end (Long play is the enemy)
Left our hearts (Close to someone's reject)
With regret, I'm 

[Trackname: With My Eyes Closed]

No time like the present
I've waited so long to be near to this
So much expectation
Is staring me right in the eyes

So I'm still standing with my eyes closed
Did I get what I wanted?
Too still, standing all alone
Had I been so demanding

'Cause you're the exception
I've tried every way to be sure of this
If I could just see
I'd open my eyes to the light
And then we'll free fall
Straight into the trap you set for me
Free fall, I'm not going back now that I see

Standing with my eyes closed
Did I get what I wanted?
Too still, standing all alone
Is this love that I'm feeling?

[Trackname: Recovery]

Drifting through the silence, searching for guarantees
Out of view, but not too far out of reach
Closer to scratching at the surface
You would swim before you had learned to sink
And that's not as easy as you think

Easy on mistakes, but no one runs to chase recovery
Easy on mistakes, but cannot get a break to recover my mind
And it's you, and you know, it's in front of me
And it's you, and you know, it's recovery

Torn in two, real you
Cross your fingers and try to see from my point of view
Come to, undo
Cross your fingers and try to see things my way

Don't stop to stare at your reflection
There's no time to sit around and critique
Do you see me bending over backwards?
Two steps and we fall out of sync

I've been trying, maybe, all of us
Take your time and know that everything is fine
Stop your crying, hear me, slow your mind
Take your time and know that everything is fine
Easy on mistakes, but no one runs to chase recovery
Easy on mistakes, but cannot get a break to recover my mind
And it's you, and you know, it's in front of me
And it's you, and you know, it's recovery

[Trackname: Right Words]

Right words, but I said them at the wrong time
Even with the right words
Knowing I could never change your mind
Right words, but I said them at the wrong time
Even with the right words
Knowing I could never change your mind

I look around, it's certain now, it's been a long day
This time it's clear you seem to see things in the wrong way
If it's just for show, I'm ready to go
You're waiting to know, you're moving too slow

Said you need to work on your timeline
Everything you wanted to see
Take what you can get if it's all mine
Everything you wanted to be
Said you need to work on your timeline
Everything you wanted to see
You can just forget, it's a fine line
Everything you wanted to be

We sit around, debate the definiton of okay
And I'm getting tired of hanging 'round
Caught in the replay
You say it's for show, I'm letting you go
You try it alone, I hope that you don't
Said you need to work on your timeline
Everything you wanted to see
Take what you can get if it's all mine
Everything you wanted to be
Said you need to work on your timeline
Everything you wanted to see
You can just forget, it's a fine line
Everything you wanted to be
Said you need to work on your timeline
Everything you wanted to see
Take what you can get if it's all mine
Everything you wanted to be
Said you need to work on your timeline
Everything you wanted to see
You can just forget, it's a fine line
Everything you wanted to be

[Trackname: Good Religion]

Lead and I'll follow you down to the bottom
Without looking back to where we started in
Too long we spent searching, who found it? What's working?
Without ever being told the truth of it

I heard you found a good religion
That final piece that you've been missing
I laid awake and had a vision
I hope you've found a good religion

Slowly I'll stumble, a creature of habit
But I won't care about the things I used to know
Try to remember, you kept it, you have it
But most of the time you know you're worse for it

I heard you found a good religion
That final piece that you've been missing
I laid awake and had a vision
I hope you've found a good religion

I heard you found a good religion
That final piece that you've been missing
I laid awake and had a vision
I hope you've found a good religion
I laid awake and had a vision
I hope you've found a good 

[Trackname: Natural State]

Could it be you're losing sight?
What you think is necessary in the night
Certain words we didn't write
You can blame the sanctuary on the light

Oh, denial
Oh, denial
Oh, denial
Oh

Swimming backwards to the sun
We were hoping that the rain would never come
Close your eyes and far we run
But we're leaving and we'll never be at home

Oh, denial
Oh, denial
Oh, denial
Oh

Oh, denial
Oh, denial
Oh, denial
Oh

[Trackname: Nothing Is Written]

Past tried to speak to me
I don't wanna hear your reasons
They won't make sense to me
Wrapped familiar feelings, we go

'Round and 'round, we're chasin' a memory
We gain some ground then downward trajectory
'Round and 'round, we keep on turning
A month of Sundays gone

Days turning into weeks
I know that it won't be easy
The way it's meant to be
Lost, searching for the meaning, we go

'Round and 'round, we're chasin' a memory
We gain some ground, then downward trajectory
'Round and 'round, we keep on turning
A month of Sundays gone

Nothing is written and nothing is set
We've done some things that I would rather forget
Love is a given and love is a bet
I'll make a promise, won't be giving up yet
'Round and 'round, we're chasin' a memory
We gain some ground, then downward trajectory
'Round and 'round, we keep on turning
A month of Sundays gone

[Trackname: Talk in Circles]

Take a step back to where it started
Where it stands, where it stood
With everyone here, when nothing was wrong
Slip through the cracks, not disregarded, still disheartened
Moving on 'cause I'm here and you're still gone

You left me hanging once again just like I knew you would
It's more than I can comprehend, I'm at a loss for words
So sweet, dipped in honey, but I see
That the look in your eyes tells it, so tell me

You hold the key, soon you will see
You were the one talkin' in circles, biting your tongue
I know you better than you know yourself
Look what you've done, you play the fool
Continue to run, talkin' in circles, biting your tongue

Taken aback, it seems regardless where your heart is
Here and now, the clock still ticks, the timer runs out
Chipped but not broken, let's steal some gold and play the cards
We can win, 'cause I'm still here, I've been all along
You left me hanging once again just like I knew you would
So many things were left unsaid, I'm at a loss for words
So sweet, dipped in honey, but I see
That the look in your eyes tells it, so tell me

You hold the key, soon you will see
You were the one talkin' in circles, biting your tongue
I know you better than you know yourself
Look what you've done, you play the fool
Continuing on, talkin' in circles, biting your tongue (Circles)
Biting your tongue

You hold the key, soon you will see
You were the one talkin' in circles, biting my tongue
I know you better, and you know better
I know you better, and you know better
And you know better, I know you better
You know better, I know you better
I know you better, I know you better

[Trackname: Clear from Far Away]

All my time passed me by like a stranger
Gravity pulled me down to the center
No, I couldn't see it
Oh, how could I sow what I couldn't find
And I couldn't feel it
A page folded over into the spine

But you won't realize 'til after it's happening, oh no
You'll never recognize 'til after it's coming on
Feel it, it's real
It's clear from far away
It's clear from far away

All my time passed me by like a stranger
Still I find I'm still looking for answers
No, I couldn't see it
Oh, how would I know what it said to me
And how could I feel it?
Sit down and descend, searching for a key

But you won't realize 'til after it's happening, oh no
You'll never recognize 'til after it's coming on
Feel it, it's real
But you won't realize 'til after it's happening, oh no
It's clear from far away
It's clear from far away

[Trackname: Gilded Lily]

Now it's been long enough to talk about it
I've started not to doubt it, just wrap my head around it
I remember when you told me it's an everyday decision
But with my double vision, how was I supposed to see the way?

Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?

Always the fool with the slowest heart
But I know you'll take me with you
We'll live in spaces between walls

Every city's got a graveyard
A service bought and paid for
Now I'm sleeping in the backyard
Passing out as night turns into day

Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Always the fool with the slowest heart
But I know you'll take me with you
We'll live in spaces between walls

Go and stretch out my arms long as they need to be
Turn off all alarms and lie to me
Go and stretch out my arms long as they need to be
Turn off all alarms and lie to me

Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?
Haven't I given enough, given enough?

Always the fool with the slowest heart
But I know you'll take me with you
I know I'll take you with me
Always the fool with the slowest heart
But I know you'll take me with you
We'll live in spaces between
