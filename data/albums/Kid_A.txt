There are two colours in my head
There are two colours in my head
What, what is that you tried to say?
What, what was that you tried to say?
Tried to say, tried to say?

[Trackname: Kid A]

I slip away
I slipped on a little white lie

We've got heads on sticks
And you've got ventriloquists
We've got heads on sticks
And you've got ventriloquists

Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed


The rats and the children will follow me out of town
Rats and children follow me out of town
Come on, 

[Trackname: The National Anthem]

Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
It's holdin' on
It's holdin' on


Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
It's holdin' on
It's holdin' on


It's holdin' on
It's holdin' on
Holdin' on

[Trackname: How to Disappear Completely]

That there
That's not me
I go
Where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey

I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah, it's gone

And I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
Strobe lights
And blowing speakers
Fireworks
And hurricanes

I'm not here
This isn't happenin'
I'm not here
I'm not here

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ahh
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ahh-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-

[Trackname: Optimistic]

Flies are buzzing 'round my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
Big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem, give me some

You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one drops a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on an animal farm

You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
I'd really like to help you, man
I'd really like to help you, man
Nervous messed up marionette
Floating 'round on a prison ship

You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can

I got a message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
I got a message I can't read
Another message I can't read

I'm on your side
Nowhere to hide
Trapdoors that open
I spiral down

You're livin' in a fantasy world
You're livin' in a fantasy world

I'm lost at sea
Don't bother me
I've lost my way
I've lost my way

You're livin' in a fantasy world
You're livin' in a fantasy world
You're livin' in a fantasy world
This beautiful world
Come back
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
I got a message I can't read
I got a message I can't read
I got a message I can't read
Come back
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Come

Who's in a bunker? Who's in a bunker?
Women and children first, and the children first, and the children
I'll laugh until my head comes off
I'll swallow 'til I burst, until I burst, until I
Who's in a bunker? Who's in a bunker?
I have seen too much, you haven't seen enough, you haven't seen it
I'll laugh until my head comes off
Women and children first, and children first, and children

Everything all of the time

[Trackname: Morning Bell]

The morning bell
The morning bell
Light another candle and

Release me
Release me

You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howlin' down the chimney

Release me
Release me
Please
Release me
Release me

Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are on the lawn with the
Furniture
Now I might as well

Sleepy jack the fire drill
Round and round and round and round and round and round and round
And round
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

The lights are on but nobody's home
Everybody wants to be a friend
The lights are on but nobody's home
Nobody wants to be a slave
Walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin'
Walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin'
Walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin'
Walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin'

[Trackname: Motion Picture Soundtrack]

Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next
