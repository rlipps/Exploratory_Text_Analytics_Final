[Trackname: Accessible]
An openness
Surrounded us
Walking through air
What’s louder than loud?
What’s louder than loud?
Walking
Through air
And in slow tide
Against the sound
Holy wave
Holy wave
Against
Against
Against
Against
Against

[Trackname: Centerline]
Wandered to the side
Found centerpieces bound to me
I’m not satisfied
Bonded to our pride
How can we expect a harmony
Safe to confide?
Floundering in the fight
Will she wake up?
Numbering all the days
Til she breaks up
Who’s wrong
Who’s right
Just want to fight it
Right before she (Marches right back to the center)
Right before she (Marches right back to the centerline)
Right before she (Marches right back to the center)
Right before she (Marches right back to the centerline)
And as she knows (They were just too similar)
And as she knows (They were just too similar)
And as she knows (They were just too similar)
And as she knows
Right before she (Marches right back to the center)
Right before she (Marches right back to the centerline)
Right before she (Marches right back to the center)
Right before she (Marches right back to the centerline)
Automatic homage
You’re good after that
Automatic homage
You’re good after that
When you see it’s always been
Bad decision for for broke a battle that you cannot win
After our lavish vacation
Thaw the iceberg, you will see
Charges from the minibar
Your original reflection staring back at me
I can get you back I mean it

[Trackname: Childish]
I’m done, I quit
Trouble’s not where it lives
It has a way
A style
Too shook to relax
That's karma crawling back
After the fact
I will throw in if you're gonna sit out
I'm known to take names if you're calling me names
It's so childish, right?
Ah we can dodge it before the expiration
Yeah we can fight it
Ah we can dodge it before the expiration
Yeah we can fight it
Ah we can dodge it before the expiration
Yeah we can fight it
Ah we can dodge it before the expiration
Yeah we can fight it
What was there to think?
I'm done, I quit
Trouble’s not where it lives
I won't relax
Karma crawling back
I'm done, I quit
Trouble’s not where it lives
I won't relax
Karma crawling back
I'm done, I quit
Trouble’s not where it lives
I won't relax
Karma crawling back
Ah we can dodge it before the expiration
Yeah we can fight it

[Trackname: Leaf]
A crest, a peak, body learns to speak
A flower at the foot of the entry
A peak, a crest, body comes to rest
A flower at the foot of the entry
I’ve been told, seem so solitary
From the day we met, I haven’t seen it yet
Would you embrace a loiter by the interchange
I regret I haven’t seen it yet
Just as the last sun falls through the leaves
Does the warm honey flow from your body
Just as we speak to gratitude’s weight
Does the Earth rise up to our bodies
The thought plucks me from the vine
Suggests, (so come for) distracts me as it handles me
Now wait, (I can’t wait) I want to be there, I want to be there
Please let me be right there
Just as the last sun falls through the leaves
Does the warm honey flow from your body
Just as we speak to gratitude’s weight
Does the Earth rise up to our bodies

[Trackname: Mine]
Get it what you want
Get it what you want
Oh wait
Getting what you want
Getting what you want
It ain't
All you admired
See if I suffer today
What you harness in the silence cannot be contained
Hold on to it for yourself then give it all away
Take it down easy
Though not always easy
Spinning on an accident the moon will wax and wane
Suffering the violence that you refuse to name
Da da da da
Da da da da da
Don’t have to give yourself away
Hold it to the light and find out who decides to stay
One at a time
I will take what is mine
And then I will expire
In a folding chair
And then I'll get it all today
And then I'll get it all today

[Trackname: Moon 2]
Was it forever since I bumped into you lookin cute
Was it a throwback when I said that I had more to tend to
Maybe a good step to say I’m sorry
Got swept up in a whole lot
Maybe a good step to say I’m leaving
Counting sheep til it fills up
Floating past you hand outreached
Hold the paddle can you see?
Pull over, there’s candy in the road
Turn around, I left the oven on
Maybe a good step to say I’m sorry
Got swept up in a whole lot
Maybe a good step to say I’m leaving
Counting sheep til it fills up
Pull over - ah ah
There’s candy in the road - oh
Turn around, I left the oven on
What was I saying imma get to it, I’m in this for me
What was I saying imma get to it, I’m in this for me
Are you mad? Cuz this is just the start!

[Trackname: Deli Run]
It was loads of fun but you missed out
Tough luck
And a deli run for the good stuff
Drew straws
And I lost
Hop over the rent-a-fence
Quick stop at the friday hang - oh
Word is that it starts at

The time to dish is up, it’s been past due
The time to dish is up, it’s been past due
A.M. lags, all morning it’s on and off
And and and and and
You say that
And I’m here again
Shoulda gone
Shoulda run
Let the rest
Turn to mush
Gracious inept debate did you have to test me then?
We stayed up pretty late for illusion mystery
If I go for a deli run will you roll with me?
If I go for a deli run will you roll with me?
If I go for a deli run will you roll with me?
Had the best weekend with everyone without you
Shoulda gone with it

[Trackname: Set It Off]
What’s your name?
Who do you embody to be?
The light?
Holding on to fire when there’s nothing to burn in sight
Handy, died in love for two
After she moved clouds for you
What’s your name
Where’s your photograph
Anybody said: Away!
Set it off, setting me free
Set it off
Set it off, setting me free
Set it off
Too young to ride, inside you run
Talking about you dead or alive, inside you run
I have to find it
I decide
I decide to run
I define it
I decide
I decide to run
To wild
To wild
Wild

[Trackname: Walking with an Enemy]
Patterns to sew
And linens to wash
We’re closed we’re closed and screaming
I was taking the blame
But not on my watch
Why don’t you notice seasons?
I was walking with an enemy
I didn’t stop as it was happening - oh fudge
I was walking with an enemy
I didn’t stop as it was happening - oh no
Besides the two of us
Besides it’s the two of us
Besides
I was walking with an enemy
I didn’t stop as it was happening - oh fudge
I was walking with an enemy
I didn’t stop as it was happening - oh no
I - I messed up
But you did too
This ain’t where you were hoping to be
So stay out
This ain’t slick or bitter to me
So stay out
Absent-mindedness catching us in a net
With none of this love
All the things he read, nothing in is head
All the things he read, nothing in is head
All the things he read, nothing in is head
Drinking the punch
And having too much
And laughing in the foyer
I was stealing a chair
And dusting it off
Why don’t you miss my secrets?
Surviving a disaster
Surviving a disaster

[Trackname: Unless]
Beat the harm
Get washed up
Me vs them
Be real then
Dictate to follow
Dictate to follow
Dictate to follow
Dictate to follow, unless
Under the dirt roads back when we were softest
Under the dirt roads back when we were strongest
Oh I understand I’d feel it out I’d pull for you but I’m wrapped up til 5
Over in a flash I’d burn a list I’d make a fist but I’m caught up til 9
Oh allow me it’s how to help to neutralize but I’m busy for now
Oh I understand I’d feel it out I’d pull for you but I’m wrapped up til 5
Do they understand
Foam we’re drowning in
Chalk it up to living learning from the less fortunate
Dictate to follow
Dictate to follow, unless
Dictate to fall
Dictate to fall

[Trackname: On Its Side the Fallen]
We confront taste
Forget the ones who told you why
We 2 4 2 save your life
5 and it saves you fine
Fine if it saves you fine
It’s a wash
In a fit o-of a-do
To, do, three
I
Can afford to say
Oh I (wake up)
Wanna fall in safe
(these eyes these eyes)
And will it hurt
When I find my sweet (we fall)
I have to find, all of that heat
Right before we burn
Right before she
Right before she
Right before she
Fall into the fire
Right before she
Right before she
Right before she
Fall into the fire
Right before she (She was too sensitive)
Right before she
Right before she
Fall into the fire
Right before she (She was too sensitive)
Right before she
Right before she
Fall into the fire
Ooh
Right before she
And on its side
Ooh much too sensitive
Fall into the fire
The fallen fire
Much too sensitive
And on its side
Sensitive
The fallen fire
Eeeeeehhhh
Oohhhhh
We took a chance
On fortunate hands
