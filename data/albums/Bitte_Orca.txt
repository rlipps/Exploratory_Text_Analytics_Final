[Trackname: Cannibal Resource]

Look around at everyone
Everyone looks alive and waiting
The wind is up, the stars are out
The sun is calm, the light is fading
But we are

Still counting on cannibal resource
OK, open your eyes
I think you're more than a terrified witness
Behind the arbitrary line

Can it ask a question?
Can it sing a melody?
Can it be interpreted?
But is it more than what the eye can see?
Maybe not

Still counting on cannibal resource
OK, open your eyes
I think you're more than a terrified witness
Behind the arbitrary line
I'm cryin'
I'm cryin'

Still counting on cannibal resource
OK, open your eyes
I think you're more than a terrified witness
Behind the arbitrary line
The arbitrary line
The arbitrary line
The arbitrary line

[Trackname: Temecula Sunrise]
I live in a new construction home
I live on the strip beyond the dealership, yeah
I live in a greenhouse and I am getting baked, wasted yeah
Temperature rising
I can feel it all the way down
And what hits the spot yeah
Like Gatorade
You and me baby, hittin’ the spot whoa-all night
Up in the light of the high Temecula sunrise
Definitely you can come and live with us
I know there’s a space for you in the basement, yeah
All you gotta do is help out with the chores and dishes
And I know you will
Rest assured, comfortable
You have nothing
The face of earth will be white
And after all, yeah, on the hill
Indian paintbrush and a couple of brown finches
Right there in the light of the high Temecula sunrise
I work on the new construction roads
I see that my silhouette is golden, yeah
I know the horizon is flat and motionless
Like EKG of a dying woman
Far away from the light of the high Temecula 

[Trackname: The Bride]
An anonymous bouquet
Raised a longing in the bride
Beckoning everyone in for the good news that
No one has any good reason to live
Tears of laughter did pervade
Your ambivalent behavior
Where was your diamond engaged but an instinct
Could be written over like a page
In a dead book, yeah
Whose cascading empathy
Could really reach beyond tomorrow
And when the dinner chime
When the clarion calls
Will be anyone listening at all

[Trackname: Stillness Is The Move]
When the child was just a child
It did not know what it was
Like a child it had no habits
No opinions about anything
Maybe I will get a job
Get a job as a waitress
Maybe waiting tables in a diner
In some remote city down the highway

After all that we’ve been through
I know we’ll make it, I know the way
The question is it true
There is nothing we can’t do
I see you along the way baby
The stillness is the move
On top of every mountain
There was a great longing
For another even higher mountain
In each city longing for a bigger city

After all that we’ve been through
I know that I will always love you
From now until forever baby
I can’t imagine anything better
After all that we’ve been through
I know we’ll make it, I know the way
The question is it true
There is nothing we can’t do
I see you along the way baby
Isn’t life under the sun just a crazy dream
Isn’t life just some mirage of the world before the world
Before the world
Why am I here and not over there
Where did time begin
Where does space end
Where do you and I
Where do you and I begin
After all that we’ve been through
I know we’ll make it, I know the way
The question is it true
There is nothing we can’t do
I see you along the way baby
The stillness is the move
After all that we’ve been through
I know we’ll make it, I know the way
The question is it true
There is nothing we can’t do
I see you along the way baby
The stillness is the 

[Trackname: Two Doves]
Geranium kisser
Skin like silk and face like glass
Don't confront me with my failures
Kiss me with your mouth open
For your love, better than wine
For your cologne is sweetly fragrant
Call on me, call on me, call on me
Your hair is like an eagle
Your two eyes are like two doves
But our bed is like a failure
All day up in the valley
At the waning of the light
To the chamber that conceived me
Call on me, call on me, call on me
Geranium killer
Throat of soil of and mind like stone
Please don't defend a silver lining
Around the halo of what is already shining
When all the planets are aligning
For an afternoon that's never ending
Call on me, call on me, call on 

[Trackname: Useful Chamber]

She is an emerald
In a shining, shining winter
Rosette in a snow globe
Ride it up, clean and gold
I spread love

She is anticipating on it
Magic and old invention
Leanin' out the window
Callin' out to all who know
She sees what no one sees

Far away, with you
While every need, and water blue
We'll sail away, on this boat
Till suddenly it's new

Who made loss or whatever alone?
I know I cannot wait that long
I don't know what I should be lookin' at
But I will look wherever I'm told
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte

I'm caught up in a storm
That I don't need no shelter from
All I want and all I need
Right here with me
You're right here with me

Call to me, soft and sweet
Cool the fire that burns in me
Catch me when I lose control
Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes
I'm caught up in a storm

Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte

[Trackname: No Intention]
The renegade feeling satisfied
You blinked and closed your eyes
You like the feeling of Saturday
You love the danger in the night
The restless corpse is collapsing wind
The breath is daffodil
What won't be coming is lapsing
Into the universal fill
Or maybe just no intention
Or maybe just no intention
When I am full with endeavor
Nothing can stop gestalt
The freshness of my reality
Makes me feel tingly and hot
When you wake up shouting "Idea!"
Is that a punishment?
You represent saying "I'm real!"
But is that what you meant?
Maybe you meant no intention
Maybe you meant no intention
No intention
No intention

[Trackname: Remade Horizon]
In the backyard
In the living room
Residential neighborhood
I've come for you
In the margins
Of the freeway
I have sat alone and wondered
Where are you?
Yeah I want to remake the horizon
Remake the horizon
In the medicine
In the weddings
Like the cormorant in evening
I see her silhouette
In the market
In the parking lot
In the uniform
You're nowhere now
Yeah I want to remake the horizon
Remake the horizon
Tossed aside the mirrored life
Echo it out, echo it out
Yeah I want to remake the horizon
Remake the 

[Trackname: Fluorescent Half Dome]
When I've had enough, when I've heard enough from police and pretenders
When I'm ready for my whole world to open up and surrender
I'll look for you, I will be searching the garden and the street
I will look into the eyes of everyone I meet
And when I finally find you, will I know?
Fluorescent half dome, fluorescent half dome, fluorescent half dome
Far beyond here, far removed from the sneering of the crowd
My eternal love sits smiling, sphinx-like and proud
Cross that disguise, I am glancing with needles in my eyes
Birds of infinity glisten, shimmering for the rest of my life
And I conceived them, not what they mean
Fluorescent half dome, fluorescent half dome
Fluorescent half dome, fluorescent half dome
Fluorescent half dome, fluorescent half dome
Fluorescent half dome, fluorescent half dome
