[Trackname: Chloe In The Afternoon]

You're all legs
I'm all nerves
Black lacquered
Horse hair whip
By your heels
Heal my hurt
Horse hair whip
Be your floor

Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon

No kisses, no real names
No kisses, no real names

Who will hear
Hear your word
Ring, ring phone
Send you home
Find my heels
Heal my hurt
White, white shirt
Back to work
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon
Chloe in the afternoon

[Trackname: Cruel]

Bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?

Forgive the kids
For they don't know how to live
Run the alleys, casually

Cruel, cruel

Bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?
If you could want that, too

They could take or leave you
So they took you and they left you
How could they be casually

Cruel, cruel, oh-hoh
Cruel, cruel, oh-hoh

Bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?
If you could want that, too
Then you'll be happy
You were the one waving flares in the air
So they could see you
And they were the zephyr blowing past you
Blowing fastly so they can't see you

Cruel, cruel, oh-hoh
Cruel, cruel, oh-hoh
Cruel, cruel, oh-hoh
Cruel, cruel, oh-

[Trackname: Cheerleader]

I've had good times with some bad guys
I've told whole lies with a half smile
Held your bare bones with my clothes on
I've thrown rocks, then hid both my arms

I don't know what good it serves
Pouring my purse in the dirt

But I-I-I-I-I don't wanna be your cheerleader no more
I-I-I-I-I don't wanna be your cheerleader no more

I've played dumb when I knew better
Tried too hard just to be clever
I know honest thieves I call family
I've seen America with no clothes on

But I-I-I-I-I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more
I-I-I-I-I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more

I don't know what I deserve
But, for you, I could work
'Cause I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more
I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more
I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more
I don't wanna be a bird eater no more
I don't wanna be a dirt eater no more
I don't wanna be a cheerleader no 

[Trackname: Surgeon]

I spent the summer on my back
Another attack
Stay in just to get along, get along, get along
Turn off the TV, wade in bed
A blue and a red
A little something to get along, get along, get along
Get along, get along, get along

Best, finest surgeon
Come cut me open
Best, finest surgeon
Come cut me open

Dressing, undressing for the wall
If mother calls
She knows well we don't get along, get along, get along
I tell the mailman, "Never you mind
I'll sift through the piles"
And for him to just get along, get along, get along
Get along, get along, get along
Best, finest surgeon
Come cut me open
Best, finest surgeon
Come cut me open
Best, finest surgeon
Come cut me open
Best, finest surgeon
Come cut me open

Best, finest surgeon
Come cut me open
Best, finest surgeon
Come cut me open
Best, finest surgeon
Come cut me open
Best, finest surgeon
Come cut me open

[Trackname: Northern Lights]

If you say it is, then I guess it is
What you say it is, but I don't feel anything
'Cause your pendulum is in swing again
Yeah, your pendulum hasn't swung back in

It's a champagne year full of sober months
Through my maudlin days, through my dry moments

I saw the Northern, Northern Lights
Convinced it was the end of times
I saw the Northern, Northern Lights

Gotta get young fast
Gotta get young quick
Gotta make this last
If it makes me sick

I saw the Northern, Northern Lights
Convinced it was the end of times
I saw the Northern, Northern Lights
Convinced it was the end of times
I saw the Northern, Northern Lights
I saw the Northern, Northern Lights
I saw the Northern, Northern Lights
I saw the Northern, Northern 

[Trackname: Strange Mercy]

Oh, little one, I know you've been tired for a long, long time
And oh, little one, I ain't been around for a little while
But when you see me, wave

Oh, little one, your Hemingway jawline looks just like his
Our father in exile
For God only knows how many years
But when you see him, wave
Through double pane

I'll be with you, lost boys
Sneaking out where the shivers won't find you

Oh, little one, I'd tell you good news that I don't believe
If it would help you sleep
Strange mercy

If I ever meet the dirty policeman who roughed you up
No, I, I don't know what
If I ever meet the dirty policeman who roughed you up
I'll be with you, lost boys
Sneaking out where the shivers won't find 

[Trackname: Neutered Fruit]

Did you ever really stare at me?
Did you ever really stare at me...
Like I stared at you?

I ate flowers in the backyard
A finely neutered fruit
Shot a hundred arrows at a doe
A hundred sparrows booed

Did you ever really stare at me?
Did you ever really stare?
Did you ever really stare at me...
Like I stared at you?

Don't run
Don't run, little rabbit, run
Don't run
Don't run, little bunny, run

Did you ever really stare at me?
Did you ever really stare?
Did you ever really stare at me...
Like I stared at you?
Did you ever ride a bear for me?
Did you ever really care
Did you ever really care for me...
Like I cared for you?

Don't run
Don't run
Don't run
Don't 

[Trackname: Champagne Year]

So I thought I'd learned my lesson
But I secretly expected
A choir at the shore
And confetti through the falling air

I make a living telling people what they want to hear
It's not a killing, but it's enough to keep the cobwebs clear

'Cause it's not a perfect plan
It's not a perfect plan
But it's the one we got


It's not a perfect plan
But it's the one we got

'Cause I make a living telling people what they want to hear
And, boy, I tell you, it's gonna be a champagne year

[Trackname: Dilettante]

Oh, Elijah
Don't make me wait
Nobody's winning
The sharks are swimming in the red

Oh, Elijah
Don't make me wait
While you are sleeping
My mind goes creaking down the wall

Slow down
Dilettante
So I can limp beside you
Iâ€™m following your houndstooth
Hang on
Street savant
My bank in my back pocket
How far you think it'd take us?

You're like a party I heard through a wall
I'm always watching you through a keyhole
But let's not forget
Let's not forget
Let's not forget
Why we crawled here
Oh, Elijah
Don't make me wait
I got no patience
For an estrangement anyway

Wake up
Avenue C
Your hometown is still sleeping

You're like a party I heard through a wall
Invite me
I'm always watching you through a keyhole
But let's not forget
Let's not forget
Let's not forget
Where we crawled from

Oh, Elijah
Don't make me wait
What is so pressing
That you can't undress me, anyway

[Trackname: Hysterical Strength]

Hey, it's your blood
That makes my veins run
It's true
So I tried to give it back to you
Young one, look at me
It's not your beast to leash
Oh, don't hold more than you can stand to carry

Must have been the case
Hysterical strength
To stand up
While the room moved off its axis
Old man, look at me
Through the teeth of your grief
Oh, don't grab more than you can stand to carry
'Cause you went off to seize
What no one else could see
Oh, and left more than we could stand to bury

But it ain't, it ain't, it ain't, it ain't
It ain't on you
No, it ain't, it ain't, it ain't, it ain't
It ain't on you
No, it ain't, it ain't, it ain't, it ain't
It ain't on you
No, it ain't, it ain't, it ain't, it ain't
It ain't on you
No, it ain't, it ain't, it ain't, it ain't
It ain't on you

[Trackname: Year Of The Tiger]

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

When I was young
Coach called me the tiger
(Oh, America, can I owe you one?)
I always had
A knack with the danger
(Oh, America, can I owe you one?)

Living in fear in the year of the tiger
Living in fear in the year of the tiger

Italian shoes
Like these rubes know the difference
Suitcase of cash
In the back of my stick shift
I had to be the best of the bourgeoisie
Now my kingdom for a cup of coffee

Living in fear in the year of the tiger
Living in fear in the year of the tiger
Living in fear in the year of the tiger
Living in fear in the year of the tiger
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Oh, America, can I owe you one?
Oh, America, can I owe you one?
Oh, America, can I owe you one?
Oh, America, can I owe you one?

Living in fear in the year of the tiger
Living in fear in the year of the tiger
Living in fear in the year of the tiger
Living in fear in the year of the tiger

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
