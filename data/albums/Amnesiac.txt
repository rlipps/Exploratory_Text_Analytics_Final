[Trackname: Packt Like Sardines In a Crushd Tin Box]

After years of waiting
Nothing came
As your life flashed before your eyes
You realize

I'm a reasonable man
Get off, get off, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case

After years of waiting

After years of waiting, nothing came
And you realize you're looking in, looking in the wrong place

I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
(I'mma try for...)
After years of waiting

I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my 

[Trackname: Pyramid Song]

I jumped in the river and what did I see?
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat

There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

I jumped into the river
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat

There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear and nothing to 

[Trackname: Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors]

There are barn doors
And there are revolving doors
Doors in the rudders of big ships and there are revolving doors

There are doors that open by themselves
There are sliding doors and, and there are secret doors
There are doors that lock and doors that don't
There are doors that let you in and out but never open
And there are trapdoors
That you can't come back 

[Trackname: You And Whose Army?]

Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy?
Well, come on, come on

You and whose army?
You and your cronies

Come on, come on
Holy Roman Empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us on
You can take us on

You and whose army?
You and your cronies

You forget so easy
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
Ghost 

[Trackname: I Might Be Wrong]

I might be wrong, I might be wrong
I could have sworn I saw a light coming on
I used to think, I used to think
There was no future left at all
I used to think

Open up, begin again

Let's go down the waterfall
Think about the good times and never look back
Never look back

What would I do? What would I do?
If I did not have you?

Open up and let me in

Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time, it's nothing at all
It's nothing at all, nothing at all
Keep it moving
Keep it moving
Ah, ah


[Trackname: Knives Out]

I want you to know
He's not coming back
Look into my eyes
I'm not coming back

So knives out
Catch the mouse
Don't look down
Shove it in your mouth

If you'd been a dog
They would have drowned you at birth
Look into my eyes
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth

So knives out
Cook him up
Squash his head
Put him in the pot

I want you to know
He's not coming back
He's bloated and frozen
Still there's no point in letting it go to waste
So knives out
Catch the mouse
Squash his head
Put him in the 

[Trackname: Morning Bell/Amnesiac]

The morning bell
The morning bell
Light another candle and

Release me
Release me

You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney

Release me
Release me, yeah
Release me
Release me

Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Your clothes are on the lawn with the
Furniture
And I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around, around, around, around
And round
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

Release me
Release me
Release me
Release 

[Trackname: Dollars and Cents]

There are better things to talk about
Be constructive
There are weapons we can use
Be constructive with your blues
Even when it's only warnings
Even when you talk the war games

Oh why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I want peace and honesty)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I want to live in the children's land
And you know maybe, maybe I)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I'll wander the promised land
I want peace and honesty)
Why don't you quiet down?
(I want to live in the promised land
And maybe wander the children's land)
Quiet down! (Yeah, and there, there we can free)

You don't live in a business world and
He never goes and you never stay
We all have goals in a liberal world
Living in times when I could stand it, babe
All over, baby's crying
It'll all be, baby, I can see out of here
All over the planet's dead
All over the planet, so let me out of here
All over the, all over the, all over the, all over the

(Quiet down)
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the mark and the yen, and yeah
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We're gonna crack your little souls
We're gonna crack your little souls
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the pounds and pence, and yeah
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We're gonna crack your little souls
Crack your little souls
We are the dollars and 

[Trackname: Like Spinning Plates]

While you make pretty speeches
I'm being cut to shreds
You feed me to the lions
A delicate balance

When this just feels like spinning plates
I'm living in Cloud Cuckoo Land
And this just feels like spinning plates
My body's floating down the muddy 

[Trackname: Life In a Glasshouse]

Once again, I'm in trouble with my only friend
She is papering the windowpanes
She is putting on a smile
Living in a glasshouse

And once again, packed like frozen food and battery hens
Think of all the starving millions
Don't talk politics and don't throw stones
Your royal highnesses

Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
But someone's listening in

Once again we are hungry for a lynching
That's a strange mistake to make
You should turn the other cheek
Living in a glasshouse

Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Only only only only
Only only only only
Only only only only
Only only only only

There's someone listening
