[Trackname: I Should Live in Salt]

Don't make me read your mind
You should know me better than that
It takes me too much time
You should know me better than that
You're not that much like me
You should know me better than that
We have different enemies
But you should know me better than that

I should leave it alone, but you're not right
I should leave it alone, but you're not right

Can't you write it on the wall?
You should know me better than that
There's no room to write it all
You should know me better than that
Can you turn the TV down?
You should know me better than that
There's too much crying in the sound
I should know you better than that

I should leave it alone, but you're not right
I should leave it alone, but you're not right
I should live in salt for leaving you behind, behind

You think about something so much
You should know me better than that
Start to slide outta touch
You should know me better than that
Tell yourself it's only noise
You should know me better than that
Learn to appreciate the void
You should know me better than that

I should live in salt for leaving you behind, behind
I should live in salt for leaving you behind, behind

I should live in salt for leaving you behind, 

[Trackname: Demons]

When I think of you in the city
The sight of you among the sights
I get the sudden sinking feeling
Of a man about to fly
It never kept me up before
Now I've been awake for days
I can't fight it anymore
I'm going through an awkward phase
I am secretly in love with
Everyone that I grew up with
I do my crying underwater
I can't get down any farther
All my drowning friends can see
Now there is no running from it
It's become the crux of me
I wish that I could rise above it

But I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons

Bats and buzzards in the sky
Alligators in the sewers
I don't even wonder why
I hide among the younger viewers
I huddle with them all night long
The worried talk to God goes on
I sincerely tried to love it
I wish that I could rise above it
But I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons

Can I stay here? I can sleep on the floor
Paint the blood and hang the palms on the door
I do not think I'm going places anymore
I wanna see the sun come up above New York
Oh, every day I start so great, and then the sunlight dims
The less I look, the more I see the pythons in the limbs
I do not know what's wrong with me, the sour is in the cut
When I walk into a room, I do not light it up
Fuck

So I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my 

[Trackname: Don't Swallow the Cap]

Gold light breaks behind the houses
I don't see what's strange about this
Tiny bubbles hang above me
It's a sign that someone loves me
I can hardly stand up right
I hit my head upon the light
I have faith but don't believe it
It's not there enough to leave it

Everything I love is on the table
Everything I love is out to sea

I have only two emotions
Careful fear and dead devotion
I can't get the balance right
With all my marbles in the fight
I see all the ones I went for
All the things I had it in for
I won't cry until I hear
'Cause I was not supposed to be here

Everything I love is on the table
Everything I love is out to sea
I'm not alone
I'll never be
And to the bone
I'm evergreen

I'm tired, I'm freezing, I'm dumb
When it gets so late I forget everyone
I need somewhere to stay
I don't think anybody I know is awake
Calm down, it's alright
Keep my arms the rest of the night
When they ask, what do I see?
I say a bright, white, beautiful heaven hanging over me

Ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

I'm not alone
I'll never be
And to the bone
I'm evergreen
And if you want (Dead seriously)
To see me cry (Don't swallow the cap)
Play "Let It Be" (Pat yourself on the back)
Or "Nevermind" (Dead seriously)
Is it time to leave? Is it time to think about
What I wanna say to the girls at the door?
I need somewhere to be
But I can't get around the river in front of me
Calm down, it's alright
Leave my arms the rest of the night
When they ask, what do I see?
I say a bright, white, beautiful heaven hanging over me

Ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

I'm not alone (Dead seriously)
I'll never be (Don't swallow the cap)
And to the bone (Pat yourself on the back)
I'm evergreen (Dead seriously)
And if you want (Dead seriously)
To see me cry (Don't swallow the cap)
Play "Let It Be" (Pat yourself on the back)
Or "Nevermind" (Dead seriously)

[Trackname: Fireproof]

You keep a lot of secrets
And I keep none
Wish I could go back
And keep some

You're fireproof
Nothing breaks your heart
You're fireproof
It's just the way you are

You tell me you're waiting
To find someone
Who isn't so hopeless
There's no one

You're fireproof
Nothing breaks your heart
You're fireproof
How'd you get so far?

You're a needle in the hay
You're the water at the door
You're a million miles away
It doesn't matter anymore
Jennifer, you are not the only reason
My head is boiling and my hands are freezing
Jennifer, you are not the only one
To sit awake until the wild feelings leave you
You're fireproof
Nothing breaks your heart
You're fireproof
It's just the way you are
You're fireproof
It's what you always say
You're fireproof
I wish I was that 

[Trackname: Sea of Love]

Oh, you say you love me, Joe
How am I supposed to know?
When you go under the waves
What am I supposed to say?

I see people on the floor
They slide into the sea
Can't stay here anymore
We're turning into fiends

If I stay here, trouble will find me
If I stay here, I'll never leave
If I stay here, trouble will find me
I believe

Joe, I'll always think of you
As the kind of child who knew
This was never gonna last
Oh, Joe, you fell so fast

Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you, but
They say love is a virtue, don't they?
Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you, but
They say love is a virtue, don't they?
Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you, but
They say love is a virtue, don't they?
Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you, but
They say love is a virtue, don't they?
I see people on the floor
They slide into the sea
Can't stay here anymore
We're turning into fiends

I see you rushing down
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing now
What did Harvard teach you?
I see you rushing down
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down
What did Harvard teach you?
I see you rushing down (Don’t drag me in)
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down (Don’t drag me in)
What did Harvard teach you?
I see you rushing down (Don’t drag me in)
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down (Don’t drag me in)
What did Harvard teach you?

[Trackname: Heavenfaced]

I could walk out, but I won’t
In my mind, I am in your arms
I wish someone would take my place
Can’t face heaven all heavenfaced
No one’s careful all the time
If you lose me, I’m gonna die

How completely high was I?
I was off by a thousand miles
Hit the ceiling, then you fall
Things are tougher than we are
I could walk out, but I won’t
In my mind, I am in your arms
I wish someone would take my place
Can’t face heaven all heavenfaced

Let’s go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let’s go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let’s go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let’s go wait out in the fields with the ones we love

She’s a griever and I believe her
It’s not a fever, it’s a freezer
I believe her and I'm a griever now
She’s a griever and I believe her
It’s not a fever, it’s a freezer
I believe her and I'm a griever now
Because we’ll all arrive in heaven alive
We’ll all arrive
Because we’ll all arrive in heaven alive
We’ll all 

[Trackname: This is the Last Time]

Oh, when I lift you up, you feel
Like a hundred times yourself
I wish everybody knew
What's so great about you
Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You don't think before you jump
And I said I wouldn't get sucked in, ah-ah-ah-ah

This is the last time

Oh, don't tell anyone I'm here
I got Tylenol and beer
I was thinking that you'd call
Somebody closer to you
Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You're the only thing I want
And I said I wouldn't cry about it, ah-ah-ah-ah

This is the last time
This is the last time

We were so under the brine
We were so vacant and kind
We were so under the brine
We were so vacant
We were so under the brine
We were so out of our minds
We were so under the brine
We were so vacant
Oh, when I lift you up, you feel
Like a hundred times yourself
I wish everybody knew
What's so great about you
Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You don't think before you jump
And I said I wouldn't get sucked in, ah-ah-ah-ah

And I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waiting anymore
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waiting anymore
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waiting anymore
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waiting anymore

Jenny, I am in trouble
Can't get these thoughts out of me
Jenny, I'm seeing double
I know this changes everything
Jenny, I am in trouble
Can't get these thoughts out of me
Jenny, I'm seeing double
I know this changes everything
It takes a lot of pain to pick me up
It takes a lot of rain in the cup
It takes a lot of pain to pick me up
It takes a lot of rain in the cup
Baby, you gave me bad ideas
Baby, you left me sad and 

[Trackname: Graceless]

Graceless
Is there a powder to erase this?
Is it dissolvable and tasteless?
You can't imagine how I hate this, graceless
I'm trying, but I'm graceless
I don't have the sunny side to face this
I am invisible and weightless
You can't imagine how I hate this, graceless

I'm trying, but I'm gone, through the glass again
Just come and find me
God loves everybody, don't remind me
I took the medicine and I went missing
Just let me hear your voice, just let me listen

Graceless
I figured out how to be faithless
But it would be a shame to waste this
You can't imagine how I hate this, graceless

I'm trying, but I'm gone, through the glass again
Just come and find me
God loves everybody, don't remind me
I took the medicine and I went missing
Just let me hear your voice, just let me listen
All of my thoughts of you
Bullets through rotten fruit
Come apart at the seams
Now I know what dying means
I am not my rosy self
Left my roses on my shelf
Take the white ones, they're my favorite
It's the side effects that save us

Grace
Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind, it'll brighten the place
Don't let them die on the vine, it's a waste
Grace

There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows without you

All of my thoughts of you
Bullets through rotten fruit
Come apart at the seams
Now I know what dying means
I am not my rosy self
Left my roses on my shelf
Take the white ones, they're my favorite
It's the side effects that save us
Grace
Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind, it'll brighten the place
Don't let 'em die on the vine, it's a waste
Grace
Grace
Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind, it'll brighten the place
Don't let them die on the vine, it's a waste


[Trackname: Slipped]

I'm in the city you hated, my eyes are falling
Counting the clicks with the living dead, my eyes are red
I'm in the crush and I hate it, my eyes are falling
I'm having trouble inside my skin, I'll try to keep my skeletons in
Is it weird to be back in the South? And can they even tell
If the city girl was ever there, or anywhere?
I'm having trouble inside my skin, I'll try to keep my skeletons in
I'll be a friend and a fuck-up and everything
But I'll never be anything you ever want me to be

I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out
I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out

I don't need any help to be breakable, believe me
I know nobody else who can laugh along to any kind of joke
I won't need any help to be lonely when you leave me
It'll be easy to cover, gather my skeletons far inside
It'll be summer in Dallas before I realize

I don't want you to grieve, but I want you to sympathize, alright
I can't blame you for losing your mind for a little while, so did I
I don't want you to change, but I want you to recognize that I
It'll be easy to cover, gather your skeletons far inside
It'll be summer in Dallas before you realize
That I'll never be anything you ever want me to be
I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out
I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts 

[Trackname: I Need My Girl]

I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
But I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I need my girl

Remember when you lost your shit and
Drove the car into the garden?
You got out and said "I'm sorry"
To the vines and no one saw it
I need my girl
I need my girl

I'm under the gun again
I know I was a -percenter then
I know I was a lot of things

But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
But I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I need my girl

There's some things that I should never
Laugh about in front of family
I tried to call you from the party
It's full of punks and cannonballers
I need my girl
I need my girl

I'm under the gun again
I know I was a -percenter then
I know I was a lot of things

But I am good, and I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
But I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and 

[Trackname: Humiliation]

I survived the dinner
Then the air went thinner
I retire to the briars
By the pool, it gets so loud
If I die this instant
Taken from the distance
They will probably list it down
Among other things around town

Got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down
In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of a white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound

And all the L.A. women
Fall asleep while swimmin'
I got paid to fish 'em out
And then one day I lost the job
And I cried a little
I got fried a little
Then she laid her eyes on mine
And she said, "Babe, you're better off"
I got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down
In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of a white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound

Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave my little life today

As a free fall advances, I'm the moron who dances
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
I was teething on roses, I was in guns and noses
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Under the withering white skies of humiliation
Under the withering white skies of humiliation

Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today
Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today

She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help 

[Trackname: Pink Rabbits]

I couldn't find quiet, I went out in the rain
I was just soaking my head to unrattle my brain
Somebody said you disappeared in a crowd
I didn't understand then, I don't understand now

Am I the one you think about
When you're sitting in your fainting chair, drinking pink rabbits?
Am I the one you think about
When you're sitting in your fainting chair, drinking pink rabbits?

And everybody was gone
You were staring down the street 'cause you were trying not to crack up

It wasn't like a rain, it was more like a sea
I didn't ask for this pain, it just came over me
Well, I love a storm, but I don't love lightning
All the waters coming up so fast, it's frightening

Am I the one you think about
When you're sitting in your fainting chair, drinking pink rabbits?
Am I the one you think about
When you're sitting in your fainting chair, drinking pink rabbits?
And everybody was gone
I was staring down the street 'cause I was trying not to crack

I was solid gold, I was in the fight
I was coming back from what seemed like a ruin
I couldn't see you coming so far
I just turn around and there you are
I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
I was just getting used to living life without you around
I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
You always said I held you way too high off the ground
You didn't see me, I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park
You didn't see me, I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart
You didn't see me, I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park
You didn't see me, I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart

And everybody was gone
You were standing in the street 'cause you were trying not to crack up
And Bona Drag was still on
Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sound kicks out
Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sound kicks out
You said it would be painless
A needle in a doll
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all
You said it would be painless
A needle in a doll
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all (When the sound kicks out)
You said it would be painless
A needle in a doll (When the sound kicks out)
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at 

[Trackname: Hard to Find]

I can see the glowing lights
I can see them every night
Really not that far away
I could be there in a day
I wonder if you live there still
I kinda think you always will
If I tried, you'd probably be
Hard to find

What I feel now about you then
I'm just glad I can't explain
You were beautiful and close and young
In those ways, we were the same
There's a lot I've not forgotten
But I let go of other things
If I tried, they'd probably be
Hard to find

They can all
Just kiss off into the air
They can all
Just kiss off into the air
I don't know why we had to lose
The ones who took so little space
We're still waiting for the ease
To cover what we can't erase
I'm not holding out for you
But I'm still watching for the signs
If I tried, you'd probably be
Hard to find

You can all
Just kiss off into the air
You can all
Just kiss off into the
