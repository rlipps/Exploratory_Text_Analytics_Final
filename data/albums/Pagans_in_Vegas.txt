If it happened it was meant to be
Offer me a free lobotomy
Got to be sedated to be seen
On the cover of your magazine
(Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
If it happened it was meant to be
Got me a lobotomy for free
Now, I'm so sedated and serene
On the cover of your magazine

Oh, and I suppose I brought it all upon myself
Starting with the question no one wants to ask themselves
Naked in the movie, make me the director's pet
Everybody told me 'take whatever you can get'

Holding off your freedom of speech
Rage against the dying of the light
Why you never say what you mean?
Rage against the dying of the light
Baby, you'll be safe with me
Rage against the dying of the light
Holding up a tattered dream
Rage against the dying, rage against the dying of the light

Oh, and I suppose I brought it all upon myself
Knowing all the questions no one wants to ask themselves
Naked in the movie, make her the director's pet
Your mother and your father wanna see you on the TV set
Everybody told her 'take whatever you can get'

Stay to soften the blow
Hand over fist
To drink and to smoke
My blood from a stone
I do expect fortunes to fold
Hand over fist
To soften the blow
Blood from a stone

Seven in the morning, do you miss me, baby?
Only if you got it bad enough, oh, oh, oh
It's four on the West Coast, girl

They tell me it's a magical world
Oh, oh, oh
It's a sinister world

[Trackname: The Shade]

I'm following the sun
That's setting in the West
We're floating on a bed of fading lights
A canopy of trees
Bears witness to the breeze
I'm falling like a feather, soft and light

Baby, there's no better time
No better time, baby, we can't find
Oh-whoa-whoa, oh-whoa-whoa

With eternal love, the stars above
All there is and ever was
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
A blade of grass, a grain of sand
The moonlit sea, to hold your hand
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all

The embers of a fire still burning as they die
Stay bright to keep us side by side

I'll be standing tall
When you call, I'll be at your side
Don't even think of giving in
Know all your fears keep creeping into your mind
Even the darkest hour soon will be over
My friend, it will be over

I've been blessed and I've been cursed
I've been the best, I've been the worst
Now I'll take what's mine

Who wants to celebrate?
And who's just fine to sit and wait?

And I just wanted you to feel the same

We've all so often heard it said
There's a road up ahead

It's all what it ain't
It's all but it ain't
So where do I start?
It's only so vain
So what did I gain?
I gave it my heart

I told myself, if I had the wealth
I could buy my way out of everything

Why'd I have to be such trouble to please?
It wouldn't be me, oh if it was easy, if it was easy
Such trouble to please
It wouldn't be easy, if it was me

Why'd I have to go and break your heart for kicks?
Why'd I have to go and break what can't be fixed?

It's all what it ain't
It's all but it ain't
So where does it start?
I want what I had
I want it so bad
I gave it my heart

I told myself, if I had the wealth
I could buy my way out of everything

Why'd I have to be such trouble to please?

[Trackname: Too Bad, So Sad]

Take me out of this state I'm in
Go somewhere I've never been
Got something trapped inside
Still alive, where's that paradise?
I thought by now I'd find
Rough justice is a long lifeline

Back and forth between the desert and the sea
Who I was and I will always be

Oh yeah, woo-hoo
Too bad, woo-hoo
So sad, woo-hoo

Get me out of this state I'm in
When I spiral down, it's a vile spin
Got something I can't hide
Still alive, it's an overwhelming drive
To prevail and get out of this jail
Dust in my eyes and a tear in my sail

Back and forth between the desert and the sea
Who I was and I will always be
Oh yeah, woo-hoo
Too bad, woo-hoo
So sad, woo-hoo

Take me out 'cause I'm all alone
Hair undone, despair unknown
Got something trapped inside
Still alive, it's a momentary ride
I've been on a thousand years too long
A thousand years too late for everything that's wrong

Back and forth between the desert and the sea
Who I was and I will always be

Oh yeah, woo-hoo
Too bad, woo-hoo
So sad, woo-hoo

Oh yeah, woo-hoo
Oh yeah, woo-hoo
Oh yeah, woo-

Ten tonnes may fall, down from the fallen sky
Onto the other side
My heart may break, don't look the other way
Don't look the other way
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh

Fools may rise - all fall in their time
Burning with the forest fires
And all we want is to feel like all we got
Didn't cost us everything
Even if we never win

Oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh
(Who am I on the other side?
You were mine on the other side) ()

Free my mind, on with the other loves
On with the other lives
And all I want is to feel like all I got
Didn't cost me everything
Even if I never win

[Trackname: Blind Valentine]

Whatever I want, whatever I do, whatever I say
Whatever I make, whatever I spend, whatever I save
The sound of the club, the kiss on your lips, it should be mine
The people you meet, the people you trust, the people you find

That's the difference, baby, between you and me
That's the difference, baby, between you and me

Sky high, in better times
When love was hard to find
Sky high,in better times
With my blind valentine
Sky high, in harder times
When love, my friend, was blind
Sky high, in harder times
With my blind valentine

Your house in that town
The window that frames the view that you saw
You keep racing down that hill
But you never fall
That's the difference, baby, between you and me
That's the difference, baby, between your life and mine

Sky high, in better times
When love was hard to find
Sky high,in better times
With my blind valentine
Sky high, in harder times
When love, my friend, was blind
Sky high, in harder times
When love was hard to find
Sky high, in better times
When trust in love was blind
Sky high, in better times
With my blind valentine

[Trackname: The Governess]

Who did you say you were?
I didn't catch your name
Falling down to earth
Down from a higher plane
Oh, it's been decades
Say, what did you see?
Oh, I've been so lonely
Won't you keep me company?

Do you remember me?
We met out on the farm
By the fire, you spoke to me
And held me in your arms
The songs you played for me
I long to understand
All along the watchtower
And castles made of sand

When there was a wilderness, we wandered wild and free
Guilt, she is the governess that guides me back to grieve
What if we were dumb enough to spend eternity
Gathering the garbage washed up on the beach?
Do you remember me?
We spoke by telephone
The bad connection had a meaning of its own
Of all the good and all the stupid shit I've done
The worst was all for me
Not hurting anyone

When there was a wilderness, I wandered wild and free
Guilt, she is the governess that guides me back to grieve
Wish that I was old enough to end the century
Gather all the garbage washed up on the
