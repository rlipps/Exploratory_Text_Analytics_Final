It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in

This quiet company
This quiet company

It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in

This quiet company
This quiet company
This quiet company

And I can't fall asleep
Without a little help
It takes a while to settle down
My shivered bones
Until the panic's out
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break

Company
This quiet company
This quiet company

But I won't follow you
Into the rabbit hole
I said I would but then I saw
Your shivered bones
They didn't want me to

It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in

It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break

[Trackname: Sorrow]

Sorrow found me when I was young
Sorrow waited, sorrow won
Sorrow, they put me on the pill
It's in my honey, it's in my milk

Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water
Cover me in rag and bone sympathy
'Cause I don't wanna get over you
I don't wanna get over you

Sorrow's my body on the waves
Sorrow's a girl inside my cake
I live in a city sorrow built
It's in my honey, it's in my milk

Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water
Cover me in rag and bone sympathy
'Cause I don't wanna get over you
I don't wanna get over you

Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water
Cover me in rag and bone sympathy
'Cause I don't wanna get over you
I don't wanna get over 

[Trackname: Anyone's Ghost]

Say you stayed at home, alone with the flu
Find out from friends, that wasn't true
Go out at night with your headphones on, again
And walk through the Manhattan valleys of the dead

Didn't wanna be your ghost
Didn't wanna be anyone's ghost
Didn't wanna be your ghost
Didn't wanna be anyone's ghost

But I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else

You said I came close as anyone's come
To live underwater for more than a month
You said it was night inside my heart, it was
You said it should tear a kid apart, it does

Didn't wanna be your ghost
Didn't wanna be anyone's ghost
Didn't wanna be your ghost
Didn't wanna be anyone's ghost
But I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else

I had a hole in the middle where the lightning went through
I told my friends not to worry
I had a hole in the middle someone's sideshow to do
I told my friends not to worry

Didn't wanna be your ghost
Didn't wanna be anyone's ghost
Didn't wanna be your ghost
Didn't wanna be anyone's 

[Trackname: Little Faith]

Little faith, follow me
I set a fire in a blackberry field
Make us laugh, or nothing will
I set a fire just to see what it kills

Now I'm stuck in New York, and the rain's coming down
I don't feel like we'll go anywhere
Stuck in New York, and the rain's coming down
Still in line for the Vanity Fair

Leave our red Southern souls
Head for the coast
Leave our red Southern souls
Everything goes

All our lonely kicks are getting harder to find
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody cries
All our lonely kicks, they'll make us saintly and thin
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody wins

Awesome prince, get your sleep
Lose your heart in history
Make us laugh or nothing will
I set a fire just to see what it kills
Don't be bitter, Anna, I know how you think
You're waiting for Radio City to sink
You'll find commiseration in everyone's eyes
The storm will suck the pretty girls into the sky

All our lonely kicks are getting harder to find
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody cries
All our lonely kicks, they'll make us saintly and thin
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody wins

Leave our red Southern souls
Head for the coast
Leave our red Southern souls
Everything 

[Trackname: Afraid of Everyone]

Venom radio and venom television
I'm afraid of everyone, I'm afraid of everyone
Lay the young blue bodies with the old red bodies
I'm afraid of everyone, I'm afraid of everyone

With my kid on my shoulders I try
Not to hurt anybody I like
But I don't have the drugs to sort
I don't have the drugs to sort it out
Sort it out

I defend my family with my orange umbrella
I'm afraid of everyone, I'm afraid of everyone
With my shiny new star-spangled tennis shoes on
I'm afraid of everyone, I'm afraid of everyone

With my kid on my shoulders I try
Not to hurt anybody I like
But I don't have the drugs to sort
I don't have the drugs to sort it out
Sort it out
I don't have the drugs to sort
I don't have the drugs to sort it out
Sort it out

[Trackname: Bloodbuzz Ohio]

Stand up straight at the foot of your love, I
Lift my shirt up
Stand up straight at the foot of your love, I
I lift my shirt up

I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees
I never married but Ohio don't remember me

Lay my head on the hood of your car, I
I take it too far
Lay my head on the hood of your car, I
Take it too far

I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
I never thought about love when I thought about home
I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
The floors are fallin' down from everybody I know

I'm on a blood buzz, yes I am
I'm on a blood buzz
I'm on a blood buzz, God I am
I'm on a blood buzz
I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees
I never married but Ohio don't remember me

I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
I never thought about love when I thought about home
I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
The floors are fallin' down from everybody I know

I'm on a blood buzz, yes I am
I'm on a blood buzz
I'm on a blood buzz, God I am
I'm on a blood 

[Trackname: Lemonworld]

So happy I was invited
Gave me a reason to get out of the city
See you inside watching swarms on TV
Livin' and dyin' in New York, it means nothing to me
I gave my heart to the army
The only sentimental thing I could think of
With cousins in colors and somewhere overseas
But it'll take a better war to kill a college man like me

I'm too tired to drive anywhere
Anyway right now, do you care if I stay?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find somethin' on this thing that means nothin' enough

Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
This pricey stuff makes me dizzy
I guess I've always been a delicate man
It takes me a day to remember a day
I didn't mean to let it get so far out of hand
I was a comfortable kid
But I don't think about it much anymore
Lay me on the table, put flowers in my mouth
And we can say that we invented a summer lovin' torture party

I'm too tired to drive anywhere
Anyway right now, do you care if I stay?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find something on this thing that means nothin' enough

You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld

Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo 

[Trackname: Runaway]

There's no savin' anything
Now we're swallowing the shine of the summer
There's no savin' anything
How we swallow the sun

But I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway
What makes you think I'm enjoyin' bein' led to the flood?
We got another thing comin' undone
And it's takin' us over

We don't bleed, when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed, when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Lose our shirts in the fire tonight
What makes you think I'm enjoyin' bein' led to the flood?
We got another thing comin' undone

But I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway
What makes you think I'm enjoyin' bein' led to the flood?
We got another thing comin' undone
And it's takin' us over
We don't bleed, when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed, when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Lose our shirts in the fire tonight
What makes you think I'm enjoyin' bein' led to the flood?
We got another thing comin' undone
We got another thing comin' undone
And it's takin' forever

I'll go bravin' everything
With you swallowin' the shine of the summer
I'll go bravin' everything
Through the shine of the sun

But I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway
What makes you think I'm enjoyin' bein' led to the flood?
We got another thing comin' undone
And it's takin' us over
We don't bleed, when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed, when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Lose our shirts in the fire tonight
What makes you think I'm enjoyin' bein' led to the flood?
We got another thing comin' undone
We got another thing comin' undone
And it's takin' us over

[Trackname: Conversation 16]

I think the kids are in trouble
Do not know what all the troubles are for
Give 'em ice for their fevers
You're the only thing I ever want anymore
Live on coffee and flowers
Try not to wonder what the weather will be
I figured out what we're missing
I tell you miserable things after you are asleep

Now we'll leave the Silver City 'cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the Silver City 'cause all the silver girls
Everything means everything

It's a Hollywood summer
You'd never believe the shitty thoughts I think
Meet our friends out for dinner
When I said what I said, I didn't mean anything
We belong in a movie
Try to hold it together 'til our friends are gone
We should swim in a fountain
Do not want to disappoint anyone
Now we'll leave the Silver City 'cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the Silver City to all the silver girls
Everything means everything

I was afraid I'd eat your brains
I was afraid I'd eat your brains
'Cause I'm evil
'Cause I'm evil

I'm a confident liar
Have my head in the oven so you'll know where I'll be
I'll try to be more romantic
I want to believe in everything you believe
I was less than amazing
I do not know what all the troubles are for
Fall asleep in your branches
You're the only thing I ever want anymore

Now we'll leave the Silver City 'cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the Silver City to all the silver girls
Everything means everything
I was afraid I'd eat your brains
I was afraid I'd eat your brains
'Cause I'm evil
'Cause I'm evil
'Cause I'm

You must be somewhere in London
You must be loving your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London
Walking Abbey Lane
I don't even think to make, I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make corrections

Famous angels never come through England
England gets the ones you never need
I'm in a Los Angeles cathedral
Minor singin' airheads sing for me

Put an ocean and a river between everybody else
Between everything, yourself and home
Put an ocean and a river between everything, yourself and home
You must be somewhere in London
You must be loving your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London
Walking Abbey Lane
I don't even think to make, I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make corrections

Famous angels never come through England
England gets the ones you never need
I'm in a Los Angeles cathedral
Minor singin' airheads sing for me
