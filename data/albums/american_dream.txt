[Trackname: oh baby]

Oh baby
Oh baby
You're having a bad dream
Here in my arms

Oh sugar
You came to me
Could all be a bad thing
Doing you harm
Oh oh oh

Oh lover
You run from me
We move like a bad scene
Shot in the dark

Oh, but please
Please wake me
But my love lies patiently
Please baby, please
And my love life waits for me
Oh love
You came to me
You were having a bad time
There in your home

Oh sugar
Give in to me
You're just having a bad dream
Ringing alarms

Oh, but please
Please shake me
But my love sits patiently
Please, baby, please
And my love plays wait and see

Oh, I'm on my knees
Yeah, I'm on my knees
I promise I'm clean
But my love life waits

And you're already gone
Yeah, you're already gone
You're already home
And my love life stumbles on
Oh baby
Lean into me
There's always a side door
Into the dark
Into the 

[Trackname: other voices]

Your feet touch the floor
I just open the window and let the light in
The light burns your eyes
But it eases with each passing frame
Yeah your head like a block
Stuffed with unwritten letters to some
Far away friends
Oh you'd write on your hand to remember
If someone, if someone would just, pass you a pen
Make your way to the toilet
These morning ablutions are all part of the dance
And these doors all have locks on them
Like tinfoil hats, man
Made for resisting (other voices)
Time isn’t over, times aren't better
So it's letting you down
You keep dragging back to it
You keep going back to the well
Oh that shit’s a dictator
Time won't be messed with
Buddy, no no no
You can't be believed
And you cannot believe what you are told
You're still a baby now
You're still a baby now
You're still a baby with soft feet and everything
You're still a baby for better or worse
Or for an hour or so
Until it's (other voices)
Please, if you’re coming home
Take me to the side
I know that time changes
To runaway
From you
You’re still a pushover for passionate people
You're still a pushover for passionate people
And you’re just a baby now
You're just a baby now
With those soft hands and doe eyes
Resisting (other voices)
And you're still a pushover for passionate people
You're still a pushover for passionate people
You’re still a pushover for passionate people
You're still a
Tell 'em Nancy

This is what's happening and it's freaking you out
I've heard it, heard it
And it sounds like the nineties
Who can you trust
And who are your friends
Who is impossible
And who is the enemy
These are the halls that we're presently haunting
And these are the people we currently haunt
Push back the walls
Push back the calendar
We've got, we've got friends who are calling us home
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You should be uncomfortable
Fake like you mean 

[Trackname: i used to]
I used to dance alone of my own volition
I used to wait all night for the rock transmissions
So where'd you go?
You led me far away
And let me go
Let me go
I used to see your hands in their weird positions
Used to like your hair when you'd watch musicians
You said we'd know
Yeah, we'd know
But that's all wrong
That's all gone
You made me throw up hands at my own traditions
And then you'd have a laugh at my inhibitions
Oh sure, we're talking tough
Yeah, we're talking tough
Yeah, we're talking tough
Put on Suburban Lawns
In prone positions
Here we go
You led me far away
And let me go
I'm never far away
Here we go
Yeah, we know
But that's all wrong
That's all wrong
I'm still trying to wake up
I'm still trying to wake up
I'm still trying to wake up
Now's your time to wake up
I'm still trying to wake up
I'm still trying to wake up
I'm still trying to wake up
Now's your time to wake up

[Trackname: change yr mind]
I ain't seen anyone for days
I still have yet to leave the bed
It's impossible
Feeling safe with it now
I'm impossible
Getting used to it now
I've just got nothing left to say
I'm in no place to get it right
And I'm not dangerous now
The way I used to be once
I'm just too old for it now
At least that seems to be true
I have a penny for your thoughts
If you could keep them to yourself
About you slipping away
I feel you slipping away
Don't want to hear it all now
Of how I'm slipping away
I can't make you a promise
We're not professionals
But if you don't like what it feels like
And if you don't
Don't like where it's been
It could be over if you change your mind
If you change your mind
If you change your mind
If you change your mind
If you change your mind
If you change your mind
You can change your mind
You can change your mind

[Trackname: how do you sleep?]
Standing on the shore, facing east
I can't feel you
Standing on the shore, facing east
Your impermanence
You're taking water
Listing lazily out of view
I remember when we were friends
I remember calling you friend
Standing on the shore my ear aimed east
I can't hear you
I can't hear you anymore
I can't hear you
I can't hear you anymore
I still remember
Laughing and fighting
I still remember
Standing on the shore, watching for you
You're painted into a corner
Whatever fits in your pockets; you'll get your due
Just like before
With all the others
You warned me about the cocaine
Then dove straight in
Yeah, you warned me about the cocaine
Then dove straight in
In hiding, where there's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
There's more for you
Standing on the shore, getting old
You left me here
Amid the vape clouds
I must admit, I miss the laughing
But not so much you
One step forward
One step forward
One step forward
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
Standing on the floor, facing you
I can't see you, your impermanence
This place is empty
Empty of you
And if I see you, it's like nothing went wrong
Yeah, if we meet again tomorrow
It's just like nothing went wrong
But there I go
Erasing our chances
Just by asking
"How do you sleep?"
(One step forward
One step forward
One step forward)
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps 

[Trackname: tonite]
Everybody's singing the same song
It goes "tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight"
I never realized these artists thought so much about dying
But truth be told we all have the same end
Could make you cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
But I'm telling you
This is the best news you're getting all week
Oh sure it's ruling the airwaves
Or what remains of the airwaves
And we're frankly thankful for the market psychology you're hipping us to
And all the hits are saying the same thing
There's only tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
And life is finite
But shit, it feels like forever
It feels like forever
Oh is everybody feeling the same stuff?
We're all wild
Except for you
And you know who you are
This is a love song
And you're getting older
I promise you this; you're getting older
And there's improvements unless
You're such a winner
That the future's a nightmare
And there's nothing I can do
Nothing anyone can do about this
And oh, I'm offering you a chance to get even
But oh, you know very well the dialect of negation
Sure enemies haunt you with spit and derision
But friends are the ones who can put you in an exile
But that's not right
And you're too sharp to be used
Or you're too shocked from being used
By these bullying children of the fabulous
Raffling off limited edition shoes
And what's it you do again?
Oh I'm a reminder
The hobbled veteran of the disk shop inquisition
Set to parry the cocksure of mem-stick filth
With my own late era middle-aged ramblings
Every lover favors the same things
It's all "touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me tonight"
We maybe realize what it is we need before we die
And luck is always better than skill at things
We're flying blind
Oh good gracious
I sound like my mom
But out of the little rooms and onto the streets
You've lost your internet and we've lost our memory
We had a paper trail that led to our secrets
But embarrassing pictures have now all been deleted
By versions of selves that we thought were the best ones
'Til versions of versions of others repeating
Come laughing at everything we thought was important
While still making mistakes that you thought you had learned from
And reasonable people know better than you
That cost in the long run but they don't know the short game
And terrible people know better than you
The use and abuse of the wants of dear listener
So you will be badgered and taunted and told that
You're missing a party that you'll never get over
You hate the idea that you're wasting your youth
That you stood in the background oh until you got older
But that's all lies
That's all lies
It's gonna have to be good enough, I can't do this anymore, my brain won't 

[Trackname: call the police]
We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nothing
We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nothing
We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nothing
This is nowhere
We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nowhere
There is no one
Here
It moves like a virus and enters our skin
The first sign divides us, the second is moving to Berlin
But that's not the state I'm in
The air is thin but that's not the state
The old guys are frightened and frightening to behold
The kids come out fighting and still doing what they're told
But you're waking a monster that will drive you from your hoary holes of gold
And your body will get cold
And we don't waste time with love
It's just death from above
Your head is on fire, your hands are getting weak
We all, we all get stupid in the heat
You've basted your brains with the shatter and the speed and defeat up on the street
And this is nowhere
The early years were boring
The quiet, unhappy punk
See mother was a cripple and my father was a drunk but gentle man
So we do the best we can
This is the plan
Wear your makeup like a man
'Cause we don't waste time with love
Yeah, we don't waste time with love
It's just a push and a shove
Well, there's a full-blown rebellion but you're easy to confuse
By trigger kids and fakers and some questionable views
Oh, call the cops, call the preachers!
Before they let us and they lose
When oh, we all start arguing the history of the Jews
You got nothing left to lose
Gives me the blues
And we don't waste time with love
And we don't waste time with love
So call the police
Yeah, call the police
Yeah, call the police
Yeah, call the police
Go, call the police
Go, call the police
Just text the cops
Yeah, call the police
You're crazy, man
Yeah, call 'em up
Just call the police
The first in line
They're gonna eat the 

[Trackname: american dream]

Wake up with somebody near you
And at someone else's place
You took acid and looked in the mirror
Watched the beard crawl around on your face
Oh, the revolution was here
That would set you free from those bourgeoisie
In the morning everything's clearer
When the sunlight exposes your age

But that's okay
And that's okay

Grab your clothes and head to the doorway
If you dance out, no one complains
Find the place where you can be boring
Where you won't need to explain
That you're sick in the head and you wish you were dead
Or at least instead of sleeping here you prefer your own bed, come on
You just suck at self-preservation
Versus someone else's pain

So you feel drained
And insane
And insane
He was leather and you were screaming
Swinging chains against the stage
And you couldn't know he was leaving
But now more will go with age, you know
So get up and stop your complaining
You know that you're the only one who's been destroying all the fun
Look what happened when you were dreaming
Then punch yourself in the face
So you kiss and you clutch but you can't fight that feeling
That your one true love is just awaiting your big meeting
So you never even asked for names
You just look right through them as if you already came

It's a drug of the heart and you can't stop the shaking
'Cause the body wants what it's terrible at taking, oh
And you can't remember the meaning
But there's no going back against this California feeling

Dream
(sha-bang, sha-bang)
American dream
(sha-bang, sha-bang)
American dream
(sha-bang, sha-bang)
American dream
(sha-bang, sha-bang)

[Trackname: emotional haircut]
I caught your eye when I stepped outside with my emotional haircut
It seems that I've been misunderstood
The look of grave concern in your eyes and your surprise at my emotional haircut
It’s better to me
It's much better than it used to be
'Cause I got eyes going every which way
I got eyes all over the place
And I got tired of the hotel room and the TV
You wish that you’d been told about whatever has led to this emotional haircut
It ain't a disease
It's just hard to do whatever you please
And treat yourself tonight
To a little love life
Now we all get ideas and then shut-shut 'em down with an emotional haircut
No I ain't Dionysian, man
Oh no buddy, no need to be concerned with this emotional haircut
It's part of the game
Yeah man, it's just part of the feat
So let's raise a glass to the bodies in here
Oh, raise a glass to the bodies in here
We’re gonna toast till the bodies all soak up the bass
Man, you’re in love with the bodies in here and your emotional haircut
Oh just get on the street
Fuck the shuffle, put your shit on repeat
You've got numbers on your phone of the dead that you can’t delete
And you got life-affirming moments in your past that you can't repeat
Yeah you've numbers on your phone of your dead that you cannot delete
And you're losing all your skin in the middle when you just can’t sleep
I know you can't calm down
Out of your windows and onto the streets
Out of your windows
Out of it
Out to
Do you know what it does?
It puts me up on my feet
It puts me on the floor
But can you hear the heartbeat
Can you hear the heartbeat
Just listen to the heartbeat
But can you hear the heartbeat
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen to it now
Listen; it's calming 

[Trackname: black screen]
You couldn't make our wedding day
Too sick to travel
You fell between a friend
And a father
I owe you dinner, man
I owe you something
You talked to me
Like I was inside
We were just waking up
For a hard
Interrupt
I meant to get to you
On the turning
Things sneak up on me
Like a landslide comes
Been saving email trails
Kept together
I read them back sometimes
To remember
The time I wrote to you
From the island
Your quick replies
Made me high
I had fear in the room
So I stopped turning up
My hands kept pushing down
In my pockets
I’m bad with people things
But I should have tried more
Been watching images
From the station
Earth one from satellites
All streaming
Feels slow at seventeen thousand miles an hour
You could be anywhere
On the black screen
On the black screen
On the black screen
On the black screen
On the black screen
You could be anywhere
On the black screen
