I know you're probably sleepin'
I got this thing I keep thinkin'
Yeah, I admit I been drinkin'
The void is back and unblinkin'

And we circle down from the sky

Yeah, so hang on me
Hang on me, hang on me
'Cause you and me
We're not meant for this world
You and me
We're not meant for this world

I know you hate my hysterics
I promise this time is different
I won't cry wolf in the kitchen
Just please, oh, please don't hang up yet

I cannot stop the taxi cab from crashin'
And only lovers will survive
Yeah, so hang on me
Hang on me, hang on me
'Cause you and me
We're not meant for this world
You and me
We're not meant for this world
You and me
We're not meant for this world
You and me
We're not meant for this

Pills to wake, pills to sleep
Pills, pills, pills every day of the week
Pills to work, pills to think
Pills, pills, pills for the family

I spent a year suspended in air
My mind on the gap, my head on the stairs
From healers to dealers and then back again
From guru to voodoo and voodoo to zen

Pills to wake, pills to sleep

Pills to work, pills to think
Pills, pills, pills for the family
Pills to grow, pills to shrink
Pills, pills, pills and a good stiff drink
Pills to fuck, pills to eat
Pills, pills, pills down the kitchen sink

I'm behind the wheel, I'm leavin' your state
I can't even swim in these waves I made
From the bath to the drain, and the plane to the stage
To the bed, to give head, to the money I made
Pills to wake, pills to sleep
Pills, pills, pills every day of the week
Pills to work, pills to think
Pills, pills, pills for the family
Pills to grow, pills to shrink

I heard the tales, fortune and blame
Tigers and wolves defanged by fame
From the chains to the reigns to the vein to the brain
Anyway there's a day and I'll pay it in pain

Come all you villains, come one and all
Come all you killers, come join the wall
Come all you wasted, wretched, and scorned
Come on and face it, come join the wall
Come climb the rafters, come out to space
Come for the answers, throw them away
Come kiss me stupid, come kiss me sore
Come find me standin' under the wall
Come all you killers, come out to play
Everyone you know will all go away
Come all you wasted, wretched, and scorned
Come watch me standin' under the wall
Come all you children, come out to play
Everyone you love will all go

In Los Ageless, the winter never comes
In Los Ageless, the mothers milk their young
But I can keep runnin'
Oh, I can keep runnin', ah-ah, oh, ah-ah
The lost sages hang out by the bar
Burn the pages of unwritten memoirs

The last days of the sunset superstars
Girls in cages playin' their guitars
But how can I leave?
I just follow the hood of my car, oh, ah-ah
In Los Ageless, the waves they never break
They build and build until you don't have no escape
But how can I leave?
I just follow my hood to the sea, go to sleep

[Trackname: Happy Birthday, Johnny]

Remember one Christmas, I gave you Jim Carroll
Intended it as a cautionary tale
You said you saw yourself inside there
Dog-eared it like a how-to manual
Remember one summer, we walked in Times Square
I showed you the zombies with hundred-inch stares
You took a Bic, set your hotel on fire
We took the blame, took the bags to the train

Happy Birthday, Johnny
Wherever you are
Happy Birthday, Johnny
Wherever you are

The last time you called it was on New Years' Eve
You asked me for dough to get somethin' to eat
Since we last spoke, you live on the street
Yeah, I wouldn't believe all the shit that you've seen

Happy New Year, Johnny
Is it twenty-three?
Happy New Year, Johnny
Are there lights on the trees?
When I said, “Let me think,” and you yelled through your teeth
Accused me of acting like all royalty
Always for show, no true charity
You saw me on magazines and TV

But if they only knew the real version of me
Only you know the secrets, the swamp, and the fear
What happened to blood? Our family?
Annie, how could you do this to me?

Of course, I blame me
When you get free, Johnny
I hope you find 

[Trackname: Savior]

You dress me up in a nurse's outfit
It rides and sticks to my thighs and my hips
You put me in a teacher's little denim skirt
Ruler and desk so I can make it hurt

But I keep you on your best behavior
Honey, I can't be your savior
Love you to the grave and farther
Honey, I am not your martyr

You dress me in a nun's black habit
Hail Mary pass, 'cause you know I'll grab it
Hand me a badge and a little billy club
Like I'm supposed to book you on a hit-and-run

Adore you to the grave and farther
Honey, I can't be your martyr
Maybe it's just human nature
But, honey, I can't be your savior

But then you say, "Please"
Then you say, "Please"
Dress me in leather
Oh, that's a little better
But that's still not it
None of this shit fits

But I keep you on your best behavior
Honey, I can't be your savior
Love you to the grave and farther
Honey, I am not your martyr

But then you say, "Please"
Then you say, "Please"
"Please, please"

[Trackname: New York]

New York isn't New York without you, love
So far in a few blocks to be so low

And if I called you from First Avenue
Well, you're the only motherfucker in the city who can handle me

New love wasn't true love, back to you, love
So much for a home run with some blue bloods

If I last-strawed you on 8th Avenue
Well, you're the only motherfucker in the city who can stand me

I have lost a hero
I have lost a friend
But for you, darling
I'd do it all again
I have lost a hero
I have lost a friend
But for you, darling
I'd do it all again
New York isn't New York without you, love
Too few of our old crew left on Astor

So, if I trade our hood for some Hollywood
Well, you're the only motherfucker in the city who would
Only motherfucker in the city who would
Only motherfucker in the city who'll forgive me

I have lost a hero
I have lost a friend
But for you, darling
I'd do it all again
I have lost a hero
I have lost a friend
But for you, darling
I'd do it all

When the Earth split in two
I was I, you were you
I run for you, run for me, too
When the wall rose and fell
And the oceans all swell
I run for you, run for me, too

Come on, Sir, just give me an answer
Come on, Sir, now I need an answer
I won't be gone with the goners
Come on, Sir, just give me the answer
I fear the future

When the club come and go
To the top of your skull
I run for you, what can I do?
When the war started new
In our bed, in our room
I'll come for you, come for me, too

Come on, Sir, just give me the answer
Come on, Sir, now I need an answer
My baby's lost to the monster
Come on, Sir, just give me the answer

How long has this been going on?
I found you in the bathtub with your clothing on
Oh, so what? Your mother did a number
So, I get gloves of rubber to clean up the spill, yeah

No, I, young lover, I'm begging you please to wake up
Young lover, I wish that I was your drug
No, I, young lover, I miss the taste of your tongue
No, I, young lover, I wish love was enough, enough

You say "You got no room to talk, babe"
You're boozin' on a midday and I don't see no cake
Oh, but these pills, I can't even pronounce them
Your thousand watts of light dim then you're gone again, yeah

No, I, young lover, I'm begging you please to wake up
Young lover, I wish that I was your drug
No, I, young lover, I miss the taste of your tongue
No, I, young lover, I wish love was enough, enough, enough

We were in Paris, the Eiffel was shining
All that I wanted was lying on tiling
I heard the robins and thought they were sirens

[Trackname: Slow Disco]

I sway in place to a slow disco
And a glass for the saints and a bow for the road

Am I thinking what everybody's thinkin'?
I'm so glad I came, but I can't wait to leave?

Slip my hand from your hand
Leave you dancin' with a ghost
Slip my hand from your hand
Leave you dancin' with a ghost

There's blood in my ears and a fool in the mirror
And the bay of mistakes couldn't get any clearer

Am I thinking what everybody's thinkin'?
I'm so glad I came, but I can't wait to leave?

Slip my hand from your hand
Leave you dancin' with a ghost
Slip my hand from your hand
Leave you dancin' with a ghost

[Trackname: Smoking Section]

Sometimes I sit in the smoking section
Hopin' one rogue spark will land in my direction
And when you stomp me out, I scream and I'll shout
"Let it happen, let it happen, let it happen"

And sometimes I feel like an inland ocean
Too big to be a lake, too small to be an attraction
And when you wander in and start to flail a bit
I let it happen, let it happen, let it happen

Sometimes I stand with a pistol in hand
I fire at the grass just to scare you right back
And when you won't run, I'm mad but I succumb
Let it happen, let it happen, let it happen

And sometimes I go to the edge of my roof
And I think I'll jump just to punish you
And if I should float on the taxis below
No one would notice, no one will know

And then I think
What could be better than love, than love, than love?
And then I think
What could be better than love, than love, than love?
It's not the end, it's not the end
It's not the end, it's not the end
It's not the end, it's not the end
