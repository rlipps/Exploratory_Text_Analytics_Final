I know
You're mine
But still
I die
I know
You're mine
But still
I die
I know
You're mine
But still
I die
I know
You're mine
But still
I die
I know

[Trackname: I Can Hardly Make You Mine]

I can hardly make you mine
Tell it to you all the time
At the end of a long day
And when I wake

If you could just give me sign
We could leave it all behind
Stop taking the long way
Before we play

I don't think I can make it
Can I owe you one
Still I lead on the days
Like a loaded gun


I can hardly make you mine
Tell it to you all the time
But you never wanted
You had to take
So I could never give you up
I guess that this is just a crush
For the end of the long day
And when I wake

But I know you're not the one or the only (only)
But we both know what it's like to be lonely (lonely)
But these fantasies they left us longing
Boy, just bring my love back to me
I guess for now this is how it'll be

I don't think I can make it
Can I owe you one (owe you one, owe you one)
Still I lead on the days
Like a loaded gun (loaded gun, loaded gun)
I don't think I can make it
Can I owe you one (owe you one, owe you one)
Still I lead on the days
Like a loaded gun (loaded gun, loaded gun

[Trackname: Always Forever]

You and me, always forever
We could stay alone together
You and me, always forever
Say you'll stay, never be severed

You know you've got me in your pocket
You don't just have to wait around
You know I keep you in my locket
Just come here and we can settle down

You and me, always forever
We could stay alone together
Heard you say things could be better
Darling, don't get a wandering eye

You know you've got me in your pocket
You don't just have to wait around
You know I keep you in my locket
Just come here and we can settle down

Oh, darling, it's alarming
To think of us apart
You know you've got me in your pocket
You don't just have to wait around
You know I keep you in my locket
Just come here and we can settle down

You and me, always forever
We could stay alone together
You and me, always forever
We could stay alone together
You and me, always forever
We could stay alone together
You and me, always forever
We could stay alone 

[Trackname: High Road]

No one really knows
Whose house you're haunting
Places that you go
Are a mystery to me
Every time you leave here
I'll keep them quiet
I guess that's all you want from me

'Cause if it's all spinning 'round the ball
And if it your world's feeling crowded and small
Maybe you can be the big star in tonight's show

But I should've took the high road
Now it's such a long way back
Instead I took the low road
Figured out it's something you can't take back
Should've took the high road
Now my days have all turned black
Instead I took the low road
Figured out it's something that we both lack
No one really knows
Just what you're wanting
Running 'round the bend
These things aren't for free
Thinking back at home
We're waiting on you
We've got our own places to be

But if it's all spinning 'round the ball
And if it your world's feeling crowded and small
Maybe you can be the big star in tonight's show
And if it's too late to pick up the call
And if you're torn up and sick of it all
Maybe you can only see far in the night's glow

But I should've took the high road
Now it's such a long way back
Instead I took the low road
Figured out it's something you can't take back
Should've took the high road
Now my days have all turned black
Instead I took the low road
Figured out it's something that we both 

[Trackname: Were Before]

I met you on the sidewalk
I hoped you were the way you were before
Don't give into the small talk
Don't give up on the things that we adore
Oh yes you know I like that
I like it like the way we were before
Still got some things to work at
These days just walking around here's such a chore

We both need it all the more
Just the way we were before
We both need it all the more
Just the way we were before

I'm pleased to see that old walk
Skipping all the cracks on the concrete
These days you're walking real tall
Or tall as someone like you've ever seen
I've been around a few blocks
I chased away the cobwebs in the street
I wound up all the old clocks
So we can say we never skipped a beat
We both need it all the more
Just the way we were before
We both need it all the more
Just the way we were before

'Cause we like that
Just like the way we were before
It's all mixed up
But that's just what we had in store

You can't fix that
You can't fix that
You can't fix that
You can't fix 

[Trackname: So Far]

I've been trying hard to keep the static low
Drown out the trouble, you know it's gonna come
Every day away our distance, oh it grows
Further and farther, so close to letting go

Reach out a hand to me
It's not over
Keep all our memories
Bring them closer

And I wonder how you sleep at night
You know that it's not just alright
Your static is so far from me

I've been trying hard to get you all alone
Seems like the good days are never gonna come
Everything you say I hear that awful tone
You're just so tired, those words are not your own

Don't let them catch you
Those fans that you wear
They cling all around you
And never could care
And I wonder how you sleep at night
You know that it's not just alright
Your static is so far from me
And I wonder how you sleep at night
You know that it's not just alright
Your static is so far from 

[Trackname: Keep Your Head Up]

Outside of your reach
I took my chance and went there
I would like to see what's there
I would like to see what's there
How about we take a trip and start it all over
How about you take me to Japan
I would like to see you there
I would like to see you there

But don't you expect me to share my love with you
Oh oh no

Gotta keep your heads up
Gotta keep your feet down
We don't want love
At least not from that crowd

How about we make a quick memory out of this
I would like to be in there
I would like to be in there
It's not an evil trick, you know that I told you
I'm not the kind that you repair
You can barely see what's there
You can barely see what's there

But don't you expect me to share my love with you
Oh oh no

Gotta keep your heads up
Gotta keep your feet down
We don't want love
At least not from that crowd
Gotta keep your heads up
Gotta keep your feet down
We don't want love
At least not from that crowd

[Trackname: TV Dream]
Darling, nearer
I can see clearer
You're guarding a new love
Oh darling, nearer
Eyes like a mirror
You're guarding a new life
I'm dreaming while you sigh
The knot's all been untied
It's all 

[Trackname: We've Got It]

I bet you think that you're the only ones
That the brightest lights will keep on burning for you
You keep on weaving 'round a smoking gun
Go on and let them talk
We'll give them something to do

We've got it
We've got it
And we won't be a problem anymore
We've got it
We've got it
All no more

There's no one else for me but you
There's only you, my love
There's no one else that's really here
There's only you, my dear
There's no one else for me but you
There's only you, my love
There's no one else that's really here
There's only you, my dear

Do you believe that what is done is done
That you can come so far and never leave them a clue
We've got it
We've got it
And we won't be a problem anymore
We've got it
We've got it
All no more

We're not here waiting up for you
There's no more time for that
We're not here praying just for you
There's no more tears to lean on
We're not here waiting up for you
Just you remember that
We're not here praying just for you
There's no more tears to cry for you

There's no one else for me but you
There's only you, my love
There's no one else that's really here
There's only you, my dear
There's no one else for me but you
There's only you, my love
There's no one else that's really here
There's only you, my 

[Trackname: Shine a Light]

Late at night alone, I was hoping you would show
Just waiting for you, trying to catch your eye
Out here on my own, there ain't nowhere else to go
I've checked in all the places you could hide
Late at night alone, I was hoping you would come
Walk me home 'cause I don't wanna stay
Out here on my own, I was hoping you would show
Walk me home, we're headed the same way

It's all I want
It's all I'm dreaming
To keep you here forever

If I'd ever got a hold, I would never let it go
Or everyone could see how hard I tried
I'd never been so bold, but these feelings let me go
I never could have dreamed you'd pass me by
The trail has gone cold and all the days of old
Shine a light and lead me back that way
The story's all told, the curtains unfold
Make it bright and make sure that it stays

It's all I want
It's all I'm dreaming
To keep you here forever

[Trackname: No Hope]

Come so defeated
It all turned to gray
The days much colder and there's not much left to say
Try to stop from shaking
Want to feel you close
You kept your distance when I needed you the most

The sun won't rise
It never shines
I know you're mine
But still I die

It makes no difference
If we turn away
No hope for me now and I'm better off that way
Only left a moment
That's all it took
No stopping me now
Foundations shook
Burn down the bridges
Burn down the town
Forget tomorrow
No lights around
Search all the ditches
And all the sounds
That joy you borrowed
Won't come around
The sun won't rise
It never shines
I know you're mine
But still I die

There's no hope
No hope
No hope
For the wicked inside my soul
No hope
No hope
No hope
For the wicked and all the pain
No hope
No hope
No hope
For the wicked inside my soul
No hope
No hope
No hope
For the wicked or the good
