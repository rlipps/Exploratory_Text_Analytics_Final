Io mi addormentavo insieme alla coscienza sporca
Stanotte torneranno un'altra volta
Io rovesciavo scope come scudi messe di fronte alla porta
Portavo sempre a letto un ansiolitico di scorta
Stavolta sarà l'ultima dicevo, forse non le vedo
Verso un altro distillato e bevo che quasi ci annego
Prego un Cristo che non mi ha salvato mai davvero
Nell'eretico racconto rosso fuoco Tardo Medioevo
Rito blasfemo tipo sabba dentro la mia tana
Sanguina la lama nella trama tipo Mario Bava
Giocano a spogliarsi e poi sorridono e piangono lava
Nessuna mi ama, sputano frasi a punta cava
Contano la fava e non provano pena
Calderoni di porzioni per la cena
Si spegne la candela e muore in volo pure l'ultima falena
Mi accarezzano la schiena nella luce di una luna piena

E le streghe ballano una danza per i maghi
Con un filtro magico per spaventare i draghi
Gira gira il mestolo, tira su il coperchio
Gira gira il mestolo
Tra gatti neri, gufi ed ossa di caribù
Mi entrano in casa mentre dormo e tornano su
Ma qui le notti delle streghe non passano più (No)
Non è un déjà vu (No), non passano più
Tagliano i cieli come ali di marabù
Ridono in bilico sui tetti e vengono giù
Ma qui le notti delle streghe non passano più (No)
Non è un déjà vu (No), non passano più (No)

Strisciano sul pavimento freddo e salgono sul letto
Praticano un culto neopagano, rito maledetto
Tagliano queste lenzuola viola con unghie e falcetto
E scrivono il mio nome sullo specchio col loro rossetto
Grammi di sale fuori dalla porta e sulle scale
Per non farle entrare, il mio portone diventa un portale
Le sento gridare sui lampioni spenti del mio viale
Mentre il mio quartiere si sta trasformando in Salem
Lingue sconosciute da Aramaico che cambiano voce
Bambole decapitate appese a un albero di noce
Teste che si incastrano nel ferro di un forcone a foce
Destino atroce, butta la croce
Abbraccia il male spirituale come il grande caprone di Goya
Corpi dati in pasto a corvi in fila sulla mangiatoia
Tagliami la lingua con una cesoia e tirerò le cuoia
Tanto so che torneranno anche solo per noia
E le streghe ballano una danza per i maghi
Con un filtro magico per spaventare i draghi
Gira gira il mestolo, tira su il coperchio
Gira gira il mestolo

Tra gatti neri, gufi ed ossa di caribù
Mi entrano in casa mentre dormo e tornano su
Ma qui le notti delle streghe non passano più (no)
Non è un déjà vu (No), non passano più
Tagliano i cieli come ali di marabù
Ridono in bilico sui tetti e vengono giù
Ma qui le notti delle streghe non passano più (no)
Non è un déjà vu (No), non passano più (no)

Bevo dal matraccio l'ultima razione di veleno
Fuori si fa giorno ed il paesaggio è di nuovo sereno
Levitavo pallido ad un metro e mezzo dal terreno
E proprio ora che se ne vanno io non posso farne a meno
Mi mancheranno come gli occhi di chi non capiva
Che quest'amore è una promessa senza aspettativa
Lingua di crotalo che bacia, brucia la saliva
Il buio ci assaliva, tornava ma non veniva
Tra gatti neri, gufi ed ossa di caribù
Mi entrano in casa mentre dormo e tornano su
Ma qui le notti delle streghe non passano più (No)
Non è un déjà vu (No), non passano più
Tagliano i cieli come ali di marabù
Ridono in bilico sui tetti e vengono giù
Ma qui le notti delle streghe non passano più (No)
Non è un déjà vu (No), non passano più (No

Flowing rain, need a vine, buckle in
Scrape it brow
Oho, oho, ...serious, never mind, like you
Oho, you know this my face
And she shadows upon they want
Silence ends, of a time, I be happy, special
I can feel you driving down, ... my expression
It’s obvious man, cause it makes your self conscious to say
That the knot in your face is a thing you ignore
That the knot in your face, is a thing you ignore
You don’t want to deny, I hold on to the day
You don’t want to live a lie, I hold on to the day
You hold on to the lie, I don’t want to die
You hold on to the lie, I hold on to the day
You hold on to the lie, I hold on to the day
I hold on to the day
I thought I was shakin, mistaken
Expressions were serial
I was taken
I needed a ride home, in the morning
But I don’t wanna sit or I might escape her gaze
I know it’s the distance, in the hallway
You’re looking for safety
I’m coming, stand by my left side
Oh, by my left side
Cause I know no harm will come to me on my left side
If the truth, I will hide in the bathroojm, till the morning
And I will look at the cartoon, on the ceiling
You are talking for loving, ...
But I see through you, I see through you
But I don’t wanna sit or I might escape her gaze
But I don’t wanna sit or I might escape her gaze
But I don’t wanna sit or I might escape her gaze
If I could focus, if I could focus
I would know the stronger of us
If I could focus, if I could focus
I would know the stronger of us

Ooh, admit to defeat
When I find you active, you’re active and you're searching for a feeling
At the end of the night, will I remember what I said?
When I focus, I focus on the pattern on the ceiling
If I can, that I know, that I will, colorful moment
Admit to defeat
I can focus, but I don’t know if I can change (admit it)
And I can reason, but I don’t know if I can change (admit it)
Cause I hold the stone at the top of the steps
And girl, would you think I’m the boy who would put the glass into your back? (admit it)
Or I’m the boy would take the glass from your back? (admit it)
Maybe I’m both in your mind
And when I try to hold you (ooh, hold you)
Try to hold you (hold you)
Seven tiles are patterned on the ceiling
Seven angles are patterned on the ceiling
Seven tiles are patterned on the ceiling
You resisted
I thought the body'd be lighter than the stone
I thought the body'd be lighter than the stone
But I’m sorry
You’re so heavy
Well you’re on your own, girl
Steady breathing, I'm covered in reasons around me
Getting a nod from another’s eyes
Concealing wilted ties, you hold me (hold)
You hold me (you hold)
You hold me (you hold)
You hold me (you hold)
Am I a trace of my only precaution?
(Do I have to ask first)
Or am I refusing to put you down?
(Do I have to ask first)
Concealing wilted ties, you hold me
(If I can, that I know, that I will, colorful moment)
I thought the body'd be lighter than the stone
I thought the body'd be lighter than the stone
And I'm sorry (oh)
You're so heavy (heavy)
Heavy for me (for me)
And I'm sorry (sorry)
You're so heavy (heavy)
Heavy for me (for me)
And I'm sorry (sorry)
You're so heavy (heavy)
Heavy for me (for me)
Ooh, I thought the body would be lighter than the stone
(Sorry, heavy, for me)
Ooh, I thought the body would be lighter than the stone
(Sorry, heavy, for me)
And I’ve learned a couple things since I set out on my own
(Sorry, heavy, for me)
Ooh, I thought the body would be lighter than the stone
(Sorry, heavy, for me)
Ooh, I thought the body would be lighter than the stone
(Sorry, heavy)
Well I'm sorry (sorry)
You're so heavy (heavy)
Well you're on your own, girl (sorry)
And I thought the body would be lighter than the stone
I thought the body would be lighter than the stone
I thought the body would be lighter than the stone
And I thought the body would be lighter than the stone
And I thought the body would be lighter than the stone
I thought the body would be lighter than the stone

[Trackname: Sequential Holdings]
Better be discreet
Better be
Underneath the window
Better watch your step
If (if) you (you) walk
Walk in through my door
Down in the corners around us
Chalk-mark paper and level the dust
Up on the ladder a short step
In order a short step
Down in the corners around us
Chalk-mark paper and level the dust
Up on the ladder a short step
In order a short step
I'm droppin'
Improve your angle with support, yeah
But I'm frozen
'Cause I recognize your knock on my door
Roy
And I still miss when I step down (still mess the step down)
And I still miss when I step down (still mess the step down)
Ooh, one, two, three
It brings no comfort to put my holdings in sequence
(Ooh, ooh, one, two, three)
That’s the spot that I am in
(One, two, three)
That’s the spot that I am in
Drop it
Sneaker tracks and sulfur to stop it
Drop it
Seven threads and your permission to stop it
Ooh, but you know that’s the spot that I'm in
Ah, that's the spot that I am in
Climb around the back in the back
Climb around the back in the back
Climb around the back in the back
Climb around the back in the back
Down in the corners around us
Chalk-mark paper and level the dust
Under the empty
You enter (empty)
And I put my hammer on the sill
Down in the corners around us
Chalk-mark paper and level the dust
Under the empty
Well, you’re my defender (empty)
But I’m not positive you will
Down in the corners around us
Chalk-mark paper and level the dust
Under the empty
Or 'cause I recognize the sound (empty)
Of your perfect little fingers (empty)
As they fall on my door
One, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
It brings no comfort to put my holdings in sequence (one, two, three)
And there’s no solace in the functions that I frequent (one, two, three)
That’s the spot that I am in
Well, I should have known better than to think you’d go too far (think you'd go far)
I should have known (I should have known)
Better than to think you'dgo too far (think you'd go far)
And I should have known
Better than to leave my door ajar
Climb around the back in the back
Oh
And I should have known
Better than to leave my door ajar
Climb around the back in the back
Oh, and I should have known (oh, I should have known)
Better than to leave my door ajar
Climb around the back in the back
Oh, well I should have known (oh, I should have known)
Better than to leave my door ajar
Climb around the back in the back

I could catch you, baby
I could hold you tight
You say you’ve got me pegged already
And I’ll let you believe it
If you want me to
It’s your decision
And it's your decision
It’s your decision
And I’ll deliver on your whim
Maybe you’ll do without it
Or maybe you’ll need it so bad
You won’t know what to do about it
It’s your decision
And I’ll deliver on your whim
And it's your decision
And maybe you’ll hold me down
Or maybe you’ll hold down right together
Maybe you'll hold down right together
And I know you stop my body where I stand
Now hold down right together
And I hold down right together
I’ll be in the cupboard
I'll be in the cupboard
Call me when you find my use
I’ll be in the cupboard
I'll be in the cupboard
Call me when you find my use
I'll be in the cupboard
And if my cell phone has power
Call me if you find a use for me
'Cause baby girl
I can’t live without it
Baby girl
I can’t live without it
Baby girl
Well, I can’t live without it
But it’s your decision
(Hold down right together)
It's your decision
(Hold down right together)
And it's your decision
(Hold down right together)
It's your decision
(Hold down right together)
It's your decision
(Hold down right together)
I could catch you, baby
With my arms under your arms
But until you choose to hold me tight
I will diminish
Just as though your patient might
