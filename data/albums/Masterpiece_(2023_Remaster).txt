Go little arrow
Shoot like a wave through the tongue of the taro
Bloom every morning
The water, the pepper
The egg, the warming
Still play that old reel
From every angle
Pushing the baby
The blood, the tangle
Old light leaking
Is it, could it, was it dreaming?
Still play that old reel
Still play that old 

[Trackname: Masterpiece - 2023 Remaster]

Years, days, makes no difference to me, babe
You look exactly the same to me
Ain’t no time, crossing your legs inside the diner
Raising your coffee to your lips, the steam

You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping her left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

You whisper to a restless ear, “Can you get me out of here?
This place smells like piss and beer, can you get me out?”
You were asking me how to get you free
I only know the recipe to roam

You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping her left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

Old stars filling up my throat
You gave 'em to me when I was born, now they’re coming out
Laying there on the hospital bed, eyes were narrow, blue and red
You took a draw of breath and said to me
You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like me
Wrapping my left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

Old friends, old mothers, dogs and brothers
There’s only so much letting go you can ask someone to do
So I keep you by my side, I will not give you to the tide
I'll even walk you in my stride, Marie

'Cause I saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping your left arm around my right
Ready to walk me through the 

[Trackname: Vegas - 2023 Remaster]
Holed up in Vegas for only one week
And I caught you tongue and cheek by the side of the road
Of an automobile expo
Turned up the volume and you started to weep
And I thought you a lamb
Even in the sigh of the headlight sea
Your tears were salty ocean
You opened up the engine and listened to it sing
And I thought you a lamb
You knew your daddy 'til you were thirteen
And then he took his leave for the likes of the land
And the far off salty ocean
We shook our bodies and we started to scream
And I asked you again
Tell me when we grow up, do we ever go home?
You said home becomes the highway
We ordered movies on a motel screen
Until you needed me warm inside of your mouth
And my skin was salty ocean
And then you recommended I'm a woman to keep
And I called you a man

[Trackname: Real Love - 2023 Remaster]

Having a bad week?
Let me touch your cheek
I will always love you

Having your face hit
Having your lip split
By the one who loves you

Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black
Real love is a heart attack

Showing your mother to any other
Letting them touch her
Looking up to her
Watching her do her makeup and hair

Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black
Real love is a heart attack
Cry like a bird, fly like a baby
Mama got drunk and Daddy went crazy
If your speech slurs, if you feel shaky, meet me out back
I'll be there waiting

Riding in the back seat
Watching the spit fly and the hummingbird cry
Oh mama, oh papa
Oh mama, oh papa
How much blood is worth the draw?
How much blood is worth the draw?

Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black

Hummingbird watching
Watching her young thing
Grow up so fast
Looking up to her
Watching her do her makeup and hair

[Trackname: Interstate - 2023 Remaster]

Though you let her down
You don't need to carry
What's far from here is not so scary
Though you cannot see her
You don't have to worry
She needs your hand though your eyes are blurry
She is getting thin
You are growing gray and white
And you don't know how to tell her as you say goodnight

Interstate, poison freeway
Takes you down the line
You could go back in time
Time
Time
Time

You could hold her close
At night in your slumber
Dream her as a child when you loved her mother
Now you're in her house
She is smiling in a dress
She is not a woman, you are just a guest
Interstate, poison freeway
Takes you down the line
You could go back in time
Time
Time
Time
Time
Time
Time

Car. I like a truck. I like a car. I like a car. I like a truck. I like a car. I like a truck. I like a truck. I like a truck. I like a truck. I like a truck. I like a truck. I like a tr-truck

[Trackname: Lorraine - 2023 Remaster]

When I saw the first time, the thunder came crashing
Your new blue eyeliner caught my distraction
And like we were two lovers forming from friction
Your mouth caught my ear with such perfect diction
And there I let you tie my hands back and take me
Oh, Lorraine on a Saturday morning
Oh, Lorraine with your soft, burning hands

We fell asleep in the back of the warehouse
I woke to you kneading and covering my mouth
And like we were hummingbirds screaming at ravens
You started to move me from fact into fable
And there I let you take me under the table
Oh, Lorraine on a Saturday morning
Oh, Lorraine with your soft, burning 

[Trackname: Paul - 2023 Remaster]

Oh, the last time I saw Paul
I was horrible and almost let him in
But I stopped and caught the wall
And my mouth got dry so all I did was take him for a spin
Yeah, we hopped inside my car
And I drove in circles 'round the freight train yard
And he turned the headlights off
Then he pulled the bottle out
And then he showed me what was love

I'll be your morning bright goodnight shadow machine
I'll be your record player, baby, if you know what I mean
I'll be your real tough cookie with the whiskey breath
I'll be a killer and a thriller and the cause of our death

In the blossom of the months
I was sure that I'd get driven off with thought
So I swallowed all of it
As I realized there was no one who could kiss away my shit

I'll be your morning bright goodnight shadow machine
I'll be your record player baby if you know what I mean
I'll be your real tough cookie with the whiskey breath
I'll be a killer and a thriller and the cause of our death
Paul, I know you said that you'd take me any way I came or went
But I'll push you from my brain
See, you're gentle, baby
I couldn't stay, I'd only bring you pain

I was your starry-eyed lover and the one that you saw
I was your hurricane rider and the woman you'd call
We were just two moonshiners on the cusp of a breath
And I've been burning for you baby since the minute I 

[Trackname: Humans - 2023 Remaster]
Humans in the honest light
Love is a cold infection alright
Why in the morn of one bad night
Do I fight your touch like a fever
Human man you loosen my mind
Loosen my hand from the beckoning knife
How in the fortress of your eye
Do you lay me down a believer?
I can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
Humans in the honest light
Love is a cold infection alright
Why in the morn of one bad night
Do I fight your touch like a fever
I can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
I'm fooling my heart
Fooling my heart
I'm fooling my heart
Fooling my heart
Humans in the honest light
Love is a cold infection alright
Why in the morn of one bad night
Do I fight your touch like a fever
I can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see

[Trackname: Velvet Ring - 2023 Remaster]

Two, three, four

Shoved in the kitchen of a city tomb
The light would flicker like a violent womb
The night was thicker than a smoky fume
And Liza waited in the room
Benny loved her like he loved no one
The way she'd laugh and hold a smoking gun
The way she always said, "What's done is done."
And he was not the only one

Love is a gentle thing
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring

A victim healer with a sharp sharp blade
Benny knew how she was getting paid
Her water broke and they would have to wade
And when he knew that she was fooling
He faced the mirror to avoid the thing
We're outta money and we sold the bling
And I just wanna take you home, I just wanna take you home
Love is a gentle thing
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
And I am wondering, —ring
I am wondering

[Trackname: Animals - 2023 Remaster]
The animals are wonderful
Such a vision in the sun, how they lay low
I catch my breath and count my dough
And I only live to run and I need to go
You and I were born and I'll make you make your mind up
Oh me
She always knew
She'll always know
That I loved her oh so well, but I need to go
You and I were born and I'll make you make your mind up
Oh me
You and I were born with the same design
Nothing in the world will make you make your mind up
If I had a choice I'd wait to find
Nothing in your eyes will tell me where you'll lie
Oh 

[Trackname: Randy - 2023 Remaster]
Oh Randy, leave it up to me
I'll pour the water if you bring the tree
Nothing looks that real to me
I only see two or three colors
What's it like to breathe in?
Find a friend and gather with him?
I'm a wolf in a city of women
You only know the light is on
Will you plant that sycamore baby?
I'll watch it grow from the second floor
I haven't left the house much lately
And you don't come around here anymore
And all those lovers in their velvet gowns
I wanna take that trip uptown
Will you tell them to let me out
When you can see the light is on?
Found a horse hair in my food
There's a raccoon in my room
There are bluejays all in bloom
All along the cement floor
Randy, they say I've gone insane
So could you take me dancing in the pouring rain?
You don't know me but you know my name
Will you say it 'til the light is gone

[Trackname: Parallels - 2023 Remaster]

Don't I make you feel alive?
Don't I give you a good home?
In a way I know you're always by my side
But today I think I've always been a long way

One hand to keep me warm
One hand to hold my chin
To be inside your arms
It's all I'm asking

Caterpillar on the floor
Can you teach me to transform?
And I'll step right in and cocoon 'til I'm born
And I can't say that I'll miss my human form much

One hand to keep me warm
One hand to hold my chin
To be inside your arms
It's all I'm asking

I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all
