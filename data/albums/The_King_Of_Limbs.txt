[Trackname: Bloom]

Open your mouth wide
A universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
So why does this still hurt?
Don't blow your mind with whys
I'm movin' out of orbit
(Turnin' in somersaults)
Turnin' in somersaults
(A giant turtle's eyes)
A giant turtle's eyes
(Jellyfish float by)
Jellyfish float by
It's what keeps me 

[Trackname: Morning Mr Magpie]

You got some nerve comin' here
You got some nerve comin' here
You stole it off, give it back
You stole it off, give it back

Good morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all the magic
And took my memory

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

You know you should, but you don't
You know you should, but you don't, ooh

Good morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all my magic
Took my 

[Trackname: Little By Little]

Don't turn nasty now, the dusts of Hell
A pillar of my salt
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the spell

Little by little, by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt
Once you've been 'round you've been around enough
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
I'm no idiot, I should look
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh

The glue won't hold, the thread unpulls
Uncurling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the seal

Obligations
Complications
Routines and schedules
The drug that will kill you
Kill you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, you
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
I'm no idiot, I should look
Little by little, by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a 

[Trackname: Feral]


(You're not)
You're not mine
I'm not yours
It's all fine
Please don't judge, judge
(You're not mine)



[Trackname: Lotus Flower]

I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove
And cut me off
And cut me off

There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
And now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free

Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast balloonin' head
Listen to your heart
We will shrink and then be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want

There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free

'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
Oh, the bird that's flown into my room

Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around the pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast balloonin' head
Listen to your 

[Trackname: Codex]

Sleight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Fantasised
No one gets hurt
You've done nothing wrong

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water's clear
And innocent
The water's clear
And innocent

[Trackname: Separator]

It's like I've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
The sweetest flowered fruits were hangin' from the trees
Fallin' off the giant bird that's been carryin' me
It's like I've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream

Just exactly as I remember
Every word, every gesture
I've my heart in my mouth

Like I've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying

And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I'm a fish now out of water

(Did so much, did so much)
Fallen off a giant bird that's been carryin' me

I fell open, I lay under
At the tip off, lost your number
I wanna slip over and get back under
And if you think this is over, then you're wrong
If you think this is over, then you're wrong
(Wake me up, will you wake me up?) If you think this is over, then you're wrong
(Wake me up, will you wake me up?) If you think this is over, then you're wrong

(Wake me up, will you wake me up?) Like I've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
(Wake me up, will you wake me up?) Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carryin'

When at last, you give in
When at last, you give in
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
