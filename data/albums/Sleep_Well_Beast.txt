[Trackname: Nobody Else Will Be There]

You said we're not so tied together
What did you mean?
Meet me in the stairwell in a second
For a glass of gin

Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there

Can you remind me the building you live in?
I'm on my way
It's getting cold again but New York's gorgeous
It's a subway day

Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there

Why are we still out here holdin' our coats?
We look like children
Goodbyes always take us half an hour
Can't we just go home?
Hey, baby, where were you back there
When I needed your help?
I thought that if I stuck my neck out
I'd get you out of your shell

My faith is sick and my skin is thin as ever
I need you alone
Goodbyes always take us half an hour
Can't we just go home?

Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be 

[Trackname: Day I Die]

I don't need you, I don't need you
Besides I barely ever see you anymore
And when I do it feels like you're only halfway there
Young mothers love me, even ghosts of
Girlfriends call from Cleveland, they will
Meet me anytime and anywhere

The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?

Don't do this, I don't do this to you
And don't expect me to enjoy it
'Cause I really don't have the courage not to turn the volume up inside my
Ears, for years I used to put my
Head inside the speakers
In the hallway when you get too high and talk forever

The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?

I get a little punchy with the vodka
Just like my great uncle Valentine Jester did
When he had to deal with those people like you
Who made no goddamn common sense
I'd rather walk all the way home right now
Than to spend one more second in this place
I'm exactly like you, Valentine, just
Come outside and leave with me

Let's just get high enough to see our problems
Let's just get high enough to see our fathers' houses

The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be?
The day I die, the day I die
Where will we be

[Trackname: Walk It Back]

I'm always thinkin' about useless things
I'm always checkin' out
I'm always motherin' myself to bits
I'm always checkin' out

Forget it, nothin' I change changes anything
I won't let it, I won't let it ruin my hair

I only take up a little of the collapsin' space
I better cut this off, don't wanna fuck it up
I only take up a little of the collapsin' space
I better cut this off, don't wanna fuck up the place

I better walk it back, walk it back
Oh, I better walk it back, walk it back, walk it back, walk it back

I try to save it for a rainy day
It's rainin' all the time
Until everything is less insane
I'm mixin' weed with wine
Forget it, nothin' I change changes anything
I won't let it, I won't let it ruin my hair

I only take up a little of the collapsin' space
I better cut this off, don't wanna fuck it up
I only take up a little of the collapsin' space
I better cut this off, don't wanna fuck it up
I only take up a little of the collapsin' space
I better cut this off, don't wanna fuck up the place

I better walk it back, walk it back
Oh, I better walk it back, walk it back, walk it back, walk it back
Oh, I better walk it back, walk it back, walk it back, walk it back


"People like you are still living in what we call the reality-based community.You believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality. That's not the way the world really works anymore. We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you are studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors, and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do"
Apparently that was written on a whiteboard with a red sharpie in the Roosevelt bedroom, sometime around Christmas . Yeah, so I can't stay

I can't stay
And I can't come back
I just keep awake
And I won't react
I'll walk through Lawrencetown
Along the tracks
My own body in my arms
But I won't collapse
So don't go dark on me
It's all alright
If I'm gonna get back to you, someday
I'll need your 

[Trackname: The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness]

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Maybe I listen more than you think
And I can tell that somebody sold you
We said we'd never let anyone in
We said we'd only die of lonely secrets

The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hidin' from me?
We're in a different kind of thing now
All night you're talkin' to God

I thought that this would all work out after a while
Now you're sayin' that I'm askin' for too much attention
Also no other faith is light enough for this place
We said we'd only die of lonely secrets

The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hidin' from me?
We're in a different kind of thing now
All night you're talkin' to God
And I cannot explain it, oh
Any other, any other way
I cannot explain it, oh
Any other, any other way


The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hidin' from me?
We're in a different kind of thing now
All night you're talkin' to God
And I cannot explain it, oh
Any other, any other way
I cannot explain it, oh
Any other, any other way
I cannot explain it, oh
Any other, any other way
I cannot explain it, oh
Any other, any other 

[Trackname: Born to Beg]

Crushed on the train, we'd stand by the window
We sweat through the hot parts of June
We hugged it out and ducked it on purpose
Nothin' else I needed to do

I was born, oh-oh
To beg for you

Later that year in the back of the Warsaw
I thought you and I might be okay
Spinnin' and quiet, you leaned in against me
Said, "I'm gonna have it all someday"

I was born, oh-oh
To beg for you
I was born, oh-oh
To beg for you

I'd cry, crawl, I'd do it all
Teakettle love, I'd do anything
I'd cry, crawl, I'd do it all
Teakettle love, I'd do anything
New York is older and changin' its skin again
It dies every ten years, and then it begins again
If your heart was in it, I'd stay a minute
I'm dyin' to be taken apart

I was born, oh-oh
To beg for you
I was born, oh-oh, oh
To beg for you

I'd cry, crawl, I'd do it all
Teakettle love, I'd do anything
I'd cry, crawl, I'd do it all
Teakettle love, I'd do anything

[Trackname: Turtleneck]

Oh my Mother, let your daughter dance with me
I'd like to spin her wild around the cottonwood tree
There's somethin' 'bout her eyes, I think her roots are rotten
This must be the reason she wears her hair up in knots, oh no

This is so embarrassin', ah, we're pissin' fits
Cryin' on our doorsteps in T-shirts loose and ripped
Some of them so out of style I cannot save them
They'll just get whatever my salvation gave them

Keep the weed next to the bed, then light the water, check for lead
Dim the lights a little lower, hide your backbone, shrug your shoulders
Give the gift that fits your head, you have to get this turtleneck

The poor, they leave their cellphones in the bathrooms of the rich
And when they try to turn 'em off everything they switch to
Is just another man in shitty suits everybody's cheerin' for
This must be the genius we've been waitin' years for, oh no

This is so embarrassin', ah, we're pissin' fits
Cryin' on our doorsteps in T-shirts loose and ripped
Some of them so out of style I cannot save them
They'll just get whatever my salvation gave them
Keep the weed next to the bed, then light the water, check for lead
Dim the lights a little lower, hide your backbone, shrug your shoulders
Give the gift that fits your head, you have to get this turtleneck


Keep the weed next to the bed, then light the water, check for lead
Dim the lights a little lower, hide your backbone, shrug your shoulders
Give the gift that fits your head, you have to get this 

[Trackname: Empire Line]

You've been sleepin' for miles
So what did you see?
Here the sky's been fallin' white flowers
And there's ice in all the trees
I've been tappin' the table
I've been hopin' to drink
There's a line that goes all the way
From my childhood to you

Can't you find a way?
Can't you find a way?
You are in this too
Can't you find a way?

I've been tryin' to see where you're goin', but you're so hard to follow
And I don't think we're getting anywhere any time soon
We have so much to cover and I don't know what I'm expectin'
You keep sayin' so many things that I wish you won't

Can't you find a way?
Can't you find a way?
You are in this too
Can't you find a way?

I've been talkin' 'bout you to myself 'cause there's nobody else
And I want what I want, and I want everything
I want everything
I've been talkin' 'bout you to myself 'cause there's nobody else
And I want what I want, and I want everything
I want everything

Can't you find a way?
Can't you find a way?
You are in this too
Can't you find a way

[Trackname: I'll Still Destroy You]

It's so easy to set off
The molecules and the caplets
They all have something against me
Nothing I do makes me feel different

This one's like your sister's best friends
In a bath callin' you to join them
Can't avoid them
This one's like your mother's arms
When she was young and sunburned in the '80s
It lasts forever

The more level they have me
The more I cannot stand me
I have helpless friendships
And bad taste in liquids

This one's like the wilderness
Without the world, I'm gonna miss those long nights
With the windows open
I keep re-readin' the same lines
Always up at 5am every mornin'
Like a baby
It's just the lights comin' on
It's just the lights comin' on

I have no possessions
No point of view or vision
I'm just tryin' to stay in touch with
Anything I'm still in touch with

The sky is getting white
I can't find a lighter anywhere, I'm goin' crazy
But I'm not crazy
Put your heels against the wall
I swear you got a little bit taller since I saw you
I'll still destroy you

It's just the lights comin' on
It's just the lights comin' on

[Trackname: Guilty Party]

You're sleepin' night and day
How'd you do it
Me, I am wide awake
Feelin' defeated

I say your name, I say I'm sorry
I know it's not workin', I'm no holiday
It's nobody's fault, no guilty party
We just got nothin', nothin' left to say

Another year gets away
Another summer of love
I don't know why I care
We miss it every summer

I say your name, I say I'm sorry
I'm the one doin' this, there's no other way
It's nobody's fault, no guilty party
I just got nothin', nothin' left to say

It all, all
Catches up to me
It all, all
Catches up to me
All the time

I say your name, I say I'm sorry
I know it's not workin', I'm no holiday
It's nobody's fault, no guilty party
We just got nothin', nothin' left to say

I say your name, I say I'm sorry
I'm the one doin' this, there's no other way
It's nobody's fault, no guilty party
I just got nothin', nothin' left to say

It all, all
Catches up to me
It all, all
Catches up to me
All the time

[Trackname: Carin at the Liquor Store]

I was a worm, I was a creature
I get on the ground the second I'd see you
You cannot command your love
I wasn't a catch, I wasn't a keeper
I was walkin' around like I was the one who found dead John Cheever
Hand in glove

So blame it on me, I really don't care
It's a foregone conclusion

I see you in stations and on invitations
You'd fall into rivers with friends on the weekends
Innocent skies above
Carin at the liquor store, I can't wait to see you
I'm walkin' around like I was the one who found dead John Cheever
In the house of love

So blame it on me, I really don't care
It's a foregone conclusion
It wasn't so bad, I wasn't that sick, got taken by love, I wasn't that quick
A foregone conclusion
It's gonna be different after tonight, you're gonna see me in a different light
It's a foregone conclusion

So blame it on me, I really don't care
It's a foregone conclusion
I'm already seein' stars in the air
It's a foregone 

[Trackname: Dark Side of the Gym]

The first time I saw you, you were walkin' out
I wanted to ask if you could stay
But you were on somethin' with your friends around
There was nothin' I could say

But I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me

The next time I saw you, you were breakin' down
A million years had gone away
You looked right at me, and I just turned around
There was still nothin' I could say

But I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me

I have dreams of anonymous castrati
Singin' to us from the trees
I have dreams of first man and first lady
Singin' to us from the sea
So I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me


I have dreams of anonymous castrati
Singin' to us from the trees
I have dreams of first man and first lady
Singin' to us from the sea

[Trackname: Sleep Well Beast]

We've been stuck out here in the hallway for way, way too long
I'm at a loss, I'm at a loss, I'm losing grip, the fabric's ripped
Go back to sleep, let me drive, let me think, let me figure it out
How to get us back to the place where we were when we first went out

I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left

Losin' parents, losin' sense, I don't know what we should do
Became a father when I was still a son, she brings it out in you
See you at the end of the party with your wild white eyes
And fillin' up the teacup with gin in your secret postcard life

I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left


We leave our saviors wrapped around the necks of new machines
Or at the ends of threads that hold their bodies to the ground
And then the men who look a little like they feel like me
Offered them some bottled water, then they cut 'em down
I came back to see if you were here, but everything was different
Your voice was low, you blended in, I could barely hear you speak
You were always my last second bright spot in the distance
Thought that you were somethin' good that I would always keep
I'll still destroy you someday, sleep well, beast; you as well, beast
I'll still destroy you someday, sleep well, beast; you as well, beast
I'll still destroy you someday, sleep well, beast; you as well, beast
I'll still destroy you someday, sleep well, beast; you as well, beast
