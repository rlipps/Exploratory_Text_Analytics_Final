[Trackname: She Works Out Too Much]

Get ready to have some fun!
Alright, here we go!
Five, four, three, two, and one
Are you ready to work out?

Don't take it the wrong way
I can never keep up
Sick of liking your selfies
Should've gone with my gut
Maybe I'm in a movie
Maybe I'm out to lunch
But I'm constantly swiping and tapping
It's never relaxing, I need a new routine

(He's trying) (She works out too much)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out
(He's trying) (She works out too much)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out enough
(He's trying)

Let's move on to the next step
Og ew ereH
!nuf evah dna esicrexE
Step, touch, step, touch
Perfect form and shape
Come on!
Get on your hands and knees
Ready? Here we go!
Welcome to the shitshow
Grab a comfortable seat
Find me in the front row
Facing the music, anyone can see

(He's trying) (She works out too much)
(She works out too much, oh no)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out
(He's trying) (She works out too much)
(She works out too much, oh no)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out enough
(He's trying)

Remember to drink a glass of water before and after you work out
Learn form and shape
Stick with it
Here we go!

I'm going off the deep end
Time to let myself go
Nothing's ever as easy as when
It never begins, the end is just a dream
(He's trying) (She works out too much)
(She works out too much, oh no)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out
(He's trying) (She works out too much)
(She works out too much, oh no)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out enough
(He's trying) (She works out too much)

The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out (She works out too much)

(She works out too much, oh no)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out enough (She works out too much)
(He's trying) (She works out too much)
The only reason we never worked out was
We didn't work out, it never works out
No, it never works out
She works out too much
And now I never work out
It didn't work out
No, it never works out
Okay, we're 

[Trackname: Little Dark Age]

Breathing in the dark, lying on its side
The ruins of the day painted with a scar
And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try
The feelings start to rot one wink at a time

Oh-oh
Forgiving who you are for what you stand to gain
Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded
Horrified with each stone
On the stage, my little dark age

Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
The carvings on the fetish say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
The humor's not the same, coming from denial

Oh-oh
I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing
All alone, open-eyed
Burn the page, my little dark age
Little dark age, little dark age
Little dark age, little dark age

I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
You know that if it hides, it doesn't go away
If I get out of bed, you'll see me standing
All alone, horrified
On the stage, my little dark age

Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come
The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind

Policemen swear to God, love's seeping from the guns
I know my friends and I would probably turn and run
If you get out of bed, come find us heading
For the bridge, bring a stone
All the rage, my little dark age

I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing
All alone, open-eyed
Burn the page, my little dark age
All alone, open-eyed
Burn the page, my little dark 

[Trackname: When You Die]

(Hey!)

I'm not that nice
I'm mean and I'm evil
Don't call me nice
I'm gonna eat your heart out
I've got some work to do
Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready to blow my lid off

Yeah!

Go fuck yourself
You heard me right
Don't call me nice again
Don't you have somewhere to be at 7:?
Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready to blow my brains out

You die
And words don't do anything
It's permanently night
And I won't feel anything
We'll all be laughing with you when you die
Words don't do anything
It's permanently night
And I won't feel anything
We'll all be laughing with you when you die

Go fuck yourself
I'm mean, not nice
You said it twice
You said it twice
Don't you have somewhere to be at 7:?

I've got some work to do
I'm gonna eat your heart out
I heard you the first 

[Trackname: Me and Michael]

Woah…

Not everyone can be like me and Michael
The only problem is forgetting which side you're on
So you think, the burning light will reappear on summer nights
Like all the rest, but they can't find out

Woah…

In every scene, it's me and Michael
Imaginary bombs, raining down from the clouds
So it seems, the danger signs will never let the feelings die
When all the best and brightest have gone

Me and Michael (woah…)
Solid as they come (woah…)
Me and Michael (woah…)
It's not a question now (woah…)
Me and Michael (woah…)
Solid as they come (woah…)
Me and Michael (woah…)
It's not a question now (woah…)
Me and Michael (woah…)
Woah…
Woah…

Binary stars sink, like the setting sun
Too happy with ourselves to notice when the change had come
So you think, the losing side would never break dividing lines
But sanctity wasn't in doubt

Me and Michael (woah…) solid as they come (woah…)
Me and Michael (woah…) it's not a question now (woah…)
It's me and Michael (woah…) solid as they come (woah…)
Me and Michael (woah…) it's not a question now (woah…)
Me and Michael (woah, woah…)

(Woah, woah…)
(Woah, woah…)
(Woah, woah…)
(Woah, woah…)
(Woah, woah…)
(Woah…)

[Trackname: TSLAMP]

On my phone

Time spent sitting all alone, time spent looking at my phone
Time spent sitting all alone, time spent looking at my phone
I try to pull the curtains back, turn you off but can't detach
When all I want and all I know is time spent looking at my phone
(On my phone)

Find me when the lights go down, signing in and signing out
Gods descend to take me home and find me staring at my phone
I'm wondering where the hours went as I'm losing consciousness
My sullen face is all aglow, time spent looking at my phone

Last thing that you need is the new shiny feature
All the memories you've shared, devoured by perverted creatures
Nothing can compete with the first time you saw her
Passing strangers on the street, spending every moment looking at their phones
(On my phone)

Time spent sitting all alone, time spent looking at my phone
Time spent sitting all alone, time spent looking at my phone
I call you, you don't call me back, almost had a heart attack
I'm listening to the window moan, time spent looking at my phone
Clouds are getting full, so you close all the windows
I would never let you die, even if our love is ornamental
You know what you need is a way to remember
You can never find the time if you spend everyday looking at your phone


You should come with me, we can lose ourselves in nothing
Copy faces from the feed and then try to turn them into something
Even if you choose to believe that it's ending
You'll come back to me again, you can go ahead and stop pretending

Doo doo doo doo doo…8

[Trackname: James]

James
If you heed the call
And you go outside, and wander off
Then home is there
Wherever you will make it
You can always say, "Who's laughing now?"

James
If you need a friend
Come right over, you don't even knock
And I'll be home
The door is always open
And we both can say, "Who's laughing now?"

Oh, James
My little doll
You just go outside and you call
James
Oh, you're never too far off


Oh, James
My little doll
You just go outside and you call
Oh, James
No, you're never too far off
If your fire's out
There's no need to shout, I'm always home
And walk on in
I'll make you tea and breakfast
And we both can say, "Who's laughing now?"

Oh, James
Oh, James
Oh, James
No, you're never too far off (Oh, James)
No, you're never too far off (Oh

[Trackname: Days That Got Away]


Days that got away
Days that got away
Days that got away
Got away, way
Days that got away
Days that got away
Days that got away
Days that got away, way
Days that got a...
Way, way, way, way, way...

[Trackname: One Thing Left to Try]

One thing left to try, see if you can make it
Before you choose the night and the silence overtakes you
If you looked into the fire and you had that conversation
Then there's one thing left to try if you want to save your life

Fear is his name, but his friends still call him God
Again and again, the thought remains

(The only way to get rid of the feeling)

I don't wanna die, wishing I'd done something
More than what's required to last until the sunset
No, I don't wanna die, thinking that I'm dreaming
There's one thing left to try if you want to change your life

Today I left those thoughts behind, behind
Over and over, you die just to feel alive

The only way to get rid of the feeling, you have to draw the line
And remember there's more than you're seeing, decide
Do you want to keep us alive?
Do you want to feel alive?
Do you want to keep us alive?
Do you want to feel alive?
(Fun is over tonight) Do you want to keep us alive?
(Fun is over tonight) Do you want to feel alive?
(Fun is over tonight) Do you want to keep us alive?
(Fun is over tonight) Do you want to feel alive?
(There's one thing left to try)
(There's one thing left to try)

[Trackname: When You're Small]

When you're big and troubles seem so far
You put your belly up to the bar
Squint your eyes, you can almost miss the dirt
You tell yourself, it couldn't hurt

But when you're small
You can't walk down the hall
When you're small
You're not very big at all

When you're low, you reach a certain point
Where you can't really see the point
You can try, but you can't see eye to eye
Yet when you're low then you really know

But when you're high
It's easier to fight
When you're high
You don't have to know why

When you're small
You don't have very far to fall
When you're small
You feel like you belong
When you're small
You can curl into a ball
When you're small
No, you're not very big at 

[Trackname: Hand It Over]

The deals we made to shake things up
And the rights that they abused
Might just fuck us over
But the doors won't shut until they're sure
There's nothing left to use
Someone's taking over
Threw it away, but now I say
It's time to hand it over

The joke's worn thin, the king stepped in
Now we'll see who is who
Look who's bending over
But the stars weren't wrong, the time felt right
We both knew it was true
The smart ones exit early
And the rest hope for a shoulder

Ooh-ooh, wahoo
Ooh-ooh, wahoo
Ooh-ooh, wahoo
Oooh

If we lose our touch, it won't mean much
If everyone's confused
Which door do we open?
Oh-oh-oh, oh…
It's the same old trick, they played their hand
Now there's one thing left to do
It's time (Hand it over)
It's yours and it's mine (Hand it over)
One thing on my mind(Hand it over)
It's rightfully mine (Hand it over)
In the dark (Hand it over)
What's yours is mine (Hand it over)
Mm, make it right (Hand it over)
And give me what's mine (Hand it over)
Oh, this time (Hand it over)
It's yours and mine (Hand it over)
Hey, it's time to hand it over
Just give me what's mine (Hand it over)
Mm, anytime (Hand it over)
It's yours and it's mine (Hand it over)
Oh, I need time (Hand it over)
No, no, it's rightfully mine (Hand it over)
Oh,
