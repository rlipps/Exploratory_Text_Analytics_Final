[Trackname: Graffiti]

I'm writing to ask you, did you achieve all you wanted to do?
Before we were dragged up, something was different and nothing was new
How did you see me? We didn't know what we wanted to be
When did we move on? I didn't feel it, nobody told me

Time to kill
Was always an illusion
Time stood still
And now we never will, never will

We wrote our names along the bathroom walls
Graffitiing our hearts across the stalls
I've been waiting for my whole life to grow old
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will

Standing in streetlights, we didn't know wrong, didn't know right
Making a mess and running in circles, getting in fights
We were just kids then, we didn't know how and didn't know when
Taking our chances, calling it off and starting again
Time to kill
Was always an illusion
Time stood still
And now we never will, never will

We wrote our names along the bathroom walls
Graffitiing our hearts across the stalls
I've been waiting for my whole life to grow old
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will

Never will
Never will

We wrote our names along the bathroom walls
Graffitiing our hearts across the stalls
I've been waiting for my whole life to grow old
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never 

[Trackname: Get Out]

Talked ourselves to death
Never saying what I wanted
Saying what I needed
I pushed you to the edge
Never knowing what I wanted
Knowing what I needed you to say

Reflections you used to see
Never look alike to me

Get out, get out
Get, get, get out
Get, get, get out of here
Can we get out, get out
Get, get, get out
Get, get, get out of here?
Good intentions never good enough
Can we get out, get out
Get, get, get out
Get, get, get out of here?

Going out my mind
Never getting what I wanted
Getting what I needed
I left myself behind
Never knowing what I wanted
Knowing what I needed you to do
Reflections you used to see
Never look alike to me

Get out, get out
Get, get, get out
Get, get, get out of here
Can we get out, get out
Get, get, get out
Get, get, get out of here?
Good intentions never good enough
Can we get out, get out
Get, get, get out
Get, get, get out of here?

So do you want to turn it around?
And do you want to show me how?
You are a kaleidoscope
You are a kaleidoscope
So do you want to turn it around?
And do you want to show me how?
You are a kaleidoscope
You are a kaleidoscope
Get out, get out
Get, get, get out
Get, get, get out of here
Can we get out, get out
Get, get, get out
Get, get, get out of here?
Good intentions never good enough
Can we get out, get out

Get, get, get out of here?

So do you want to turn it around?
And do you want to show me how?
You are a kaleidoscope
You are a kaleidoscope
So do you want to turn it around?
And do you want to show me how?
You are a kaleidoscope

[Trackname: Deliverance]

Careful when you're swimming in the holy water
Drowning in your own beliefs
Careful when you're standing at a broken altar
Asking if we feel relief
Careful when you're looking for a true confession
Mirror what you wanna see
Careful when you're telling us about obsession
Saying that we're never free

You better hold on, hold on, hold on
You better hold on to what you love
You better give up, give up, give up
You better give up on giving up

Is it deliver-iver-iverance
If you can never, never change?
Is it deliver-iver-iverance
If you hurt me in exchange?

Trust me when I tell you 'bout my own convictions
Made my mind up long ago
Trust me when I tell you it's a contradiction
Wishing that I didn't know
Trust me that I struggle with all your destruction
Screaming that I told you so
Trust me when I talk about the disillusion
Building up and letting go
You better hold on, hold on, hold on
You better hold on to what you love
You better give up, give up, give up
You better give up on giving up

Is it deliver-iver-iverance
If you can never, never change?
Is it deliver-iver-iverance
If you hurt me in exchange?

Look in my eyes when you say it, say it
Look in my eyes like you mean it, mean it
Look in my eyes when you say it, say it
Look in my eyes like you mean it

Is it deliver-iver-iverance
If you can never, never change?
Is it deliver-iver-iverance
If you hurt me in exchange?
Is it deliver-iver-iverance
(Look in my eyes when you say it, say it)
If you can never, never change
(Look in my eyes like you mean it, mean it)
Is it deliver-iver-iverance
(Look in my eyes when you say it, say it)
If you hurt me in exchange
(Look in my eyes like you mean it, mean it, mean it)
Like you mean it
Like you mean it
Like you mean 

[Trackname: My Enemy]

I got no more time to hear what you think about me
Because all your words are so cold, so callous, so clean
In the moment, you could be honest, you could wake up, up
But your jealousy is more blind than luck

And you could be my enemy
And you could be my judge
If you could start remembering all the time that you used up
And you could be my remedy
If you could show me love
If I could stop remembering all the time that you used up

I got no more time to hear who you think we should blame
Because all your words are so vile, so vicious, so vain
In the end, we did all the damage that you could want, want
But the emptiness will go on and on

And you could be my enemy
And you could be my judge
If you could start remembering all the time that you used up
And you could be my remedy
If you could show me love
If I could stop remembering all the time that you used up
And you could be my enemy
And you could be my judge
If you could start remembering all the time that you used up
And you could be my remedy
If you could show me love
If I could stop remembering all the time that you used 

[Trackname: Forever]

Savour the taste
Savour the pain
I don't expect you to release me
Jumping the gun
Holding my tongue
I never ask you to forgive me

And you will never see my side
And I will always think I'm right
But I always regret the night
I told you I would hate you 'til forever

(Forever, forever, forever)
(Forever, forever, forever, forever)
(Forever, forever, forever, forever)
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
(Forever, forever, forever) Oh, oh
(Forever, forever, forever, forever) Oh, oh
(Forever, forever, forever, forever)
I told you I would hate you 'til forever

Playing the part
Playing the game
I don't expect you to believe me
Missing the mark
We tear it apart
I never ask you why you need me
And you will never see my side
And I will always think I'm right
But I always regret the night
I told you I would hate you 'til forever

(Forever, forever, forever)
(Forever, forever, forever, forever)
(Forever, forever, forever, forever)
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
(Forever, forever, forever) Oh, oh
(Forever, forever, forever, forever) Oh, oh
(Forever, forever, forever, forever)
I told you I would hate you 'til forever

What else should I say?
What else could I do?
Maybe it's too much for you
What else should I say?
What else could I do?
Maybe I am just too much for you

(Forever, forever, forever, forever)
(Forever, forever, forever, forever)
(Forever, forever, forever, forever)
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
(Forever, forever, forever) Oh, oh
(Forever, forever, forever, forever) Oh, oh

[Trackname: Never Say Die]

Wasn't it gonna be fun and wasn't it gonna be new?
Wasn't it gonna be different and wasn't it gonna be true?
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
Weren't you gonna be sorry and weren't you gonna be pure?
Weren't we gonna be honest and weren't we gonna be more?
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?

All you want is to play at playing God
But I'm falling in and falling out
All you need is to play at playing God
And I'm falling in and falling out

Never, never, never ever
Never ever, ever say die

Never, never, never ever

Never, never, never ever
Never ever, ever stop

Never, never, never ever
Never ever, ever say die

Weren't you trying forgiveness and weren't you trying to stay?
Weren't you trying to look up and weren't you trying to pray?
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?

All you want is to play at playing God
But I'm falling in and falling out
All you need is to play at playing God
And I'm falling in and falling out

Never, never, never ever

[Trackname: Miracle]

Ask me no questions, I will tell you no lies
Careful what you wish for
We're looking for angels in the darkest of skies
Saying that we wanted more
I feel like I'm falling, but I'm trying to fly
Where does all the good go?
We're looking for answers in the highest of highs
But will we ever, ever know?
And I need you to know I'm not asking for a miracle
But if love is enough, could you let it show?
If you feel it, could you let me know?
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh) If you feel it, could you let me know?
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh) I'm not asking for a miracle

Ask for forever when the end is in sight
Showing what you want to
We're looking for light inside an ocean of night
But will we ever see it through?
And I need you to know I'm not asking for a miracle
But if love is enough, could you let it show?
If you feel it, could you let me know?
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh) If you feel it, could you let me know?

(Oh, oh) I'm not asking for a miracle
Ask me no questions, I will tell you no lies
I'm not asking for a miracle
We're looking for angels in the darkest of skies
I'm not asking for a miracle (I'm not asking for a miracle)
(I'm not asking for a miracle)

I'm not asking for a miracle
If you feel it, could you let me know?

Ask me no questions, I will tell you no lies

[Trackname: Graves]

Do you really believe that you can ever be sure?
They're leavin' bodies in stairwells, a-washing up on the shore
Do you really expect us to care what you're waitin' for
When you're high in your castle
Keepin' an eye on the door, the door, the door?

If I only see what I can see
I know it isn't there
And if I only need what I can keep
I know it isn't fair

Oh baby, you can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing, oh, I will stop at nothing
And you can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing, no, I will stop at nothing now

Do you really believe that you are one of a kind?
If you don't have a heart, I can offer you mine
Do you really expect that you will always be fine
When you're high on your throne, and
Never toein' the line, the line, the line?
If I only see what I can see
I know it isn't there
And if I only need what I can keep
I know it isn't fair

Oh baby, you can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing, oh, I will stop at nothing
And you can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing, no, I will stop at nothing now

Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away
From all that we've done
Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away
From all that we've done

Oh baby, you can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing, oh, I will stop at nothing
And you can look away
While they're dancing on our graves
But I will stop at nothing, no, I will stop at nothing now
Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away

From all that we've done

Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away
From all that we've done

Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away
Looking away, you're looking away
From all that we've done

[Trackname: Heaven/Hell]

Am I real if you can see right through me?
If I'm in a magazine?
Do you believe it? Do you believe?
Do you believe it? Do you believe?
Am I real if I'm a broken record
Selling you what you don't need?
Do you believe it? Do you believe?
Do you believe it? I don't

Do you ever wonder what we learned?
We can raise our glasses dancing on the ashes as it burns
Have you reached the point of no return?
We can raise our glasses dancing on the ashes as it burns

Is this heaven or is this hell?
Through a silver screen, you're saying what you mean
But I can't tell
Is this heaven or is this hell?
If none of this is real, then show me what you feel
'Cause I can't tell

Is it right if I'm a perfect actress
Playing the princess in distress?
Is it enough yet? Is it enough?
Is it enough yet? Is it enough?
Is it alright if I save myself and
If I clean up my own mess?
Is it enough yet? Is it enough?
Is it enough yet? 'Cause I've had enough
Do you ever wonder what we learned?
We can raise our glasses dancing on the ashes as it burns
Have you reached the point of no return?
We can raise our glasses dancing on the ashes as it burns

Is this heaven or is this hell?
Through a silver screen, you're saying what you mean
But I can't tell
Is this heaven or is this hell?
If none of this is real, then show me what you feel
'Cause I can't tell

Is this heaven or is this hell?
Through a silver screen, you're saying what you mean
But I can't tell
Is this heaven or is this hell?
If none of this is real, then show me what you feel

[Trackname: God's Plan]

You belong with me
I'm tracing a line
I'm tracing the lines of your hand
You collapse in threes
Show me inside
Wasted and wide like dead sand
You confide in me
Shamed and maligned
Shaped and defined by God's plan
You belong to me
You're crossing a line
You're cold and confined, you're no friend

I wait for a sign
I'm tracing the lines of your hand
Of your hand
Of your hand
What's yours can be mine
I'm tracing the lines of your hand
Of your hand
Of your hand

You belong with me
And tonight, at least we can die in silence
Is it worth it now?
Tell me, is it worth it now?
Is it worth it now

[Trackname: Really Gone]

I can never tell what you want
Even with time, you never learn to move on
I'm trying my best to lift you up, to repair
But when I stop, you never seem to stay there

And I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'll wait until you're really gone
And try to find another way
But I cannot stay

I can do no right for doing wrong
I'll swallow my pride, I only want to belong
I'm trying my best to toughen up for these days
And maybe I'll find another time for this place

And I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'll wait until you're really gone
And try to find another way
But I cannot stay
I'll try to find another way
But I cannot 

[Trackname: ii]

The truth exists somewhere between the dark and the light
We love each other in theory
You never, you never smile with your eyes
If you have a story, go tell it
Tell it to the skyscrapers
Tell it to the sky

[Trackname: Wonderland]

I am talking in my sleep
Hiding inside my dreams
Fighting inside my head
Scaring myself to death
We live in a wonderland
Like blood isn't on our hands
When will it be enough?

When will I say I knew we had to get away
Knew we had to get away
Knew we had to get away from the storm?

Can't live forever with my head in the clouds
Can't predict the weather with my feet on the ground
You tell me that we'll be alright, but I don't know if you're right
I can't live forever with my head and my heart in the clouds

I am counting every sheep
But these rabbit holes run deep
Trying to be so right
Desperate to start a fight
All of this pointless talk
Why can't I turn it off?
When will it all just stop?
When will I say I knew we had to get away
Knew we had to get away
Knew we had to get away all along?

Can't live forever with my head in the clouds
Can't predict the weather with my feet on the ground
You tell me that we'll be alright, but I don't know if you're right
I can't live forever with my head and my heart in the clouds


Can't live forever with my head in the clouds
Can't predict the weather with my feet on the ground
You tell me that we'll be alright, but I don't know if you're right
I can't live forever with my head and my heart in the
