[Trackname: Time to Pretend]

I'm feelin' rough, I'm feelin' raw
I'm in the prime of my life
Let's make some music, make some money
Find some models for wives
I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin
And fuck with the stars
You man the island and the cocaine
And the elegant cars

This is our decision, to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?

Forget about our mothers and our friends
We're fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend

I'll miss the playgrounds
And the animals and diggin' up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother
And the weight of the world
I'll miss my sister, miss my father
Miss my dog and my home
Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom
And the time spent alone
But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten, life can always start up anew
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models, everything must run its course

We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end
We were fated to pretend
To pretend
We're fated to pretend
To pretend

I said yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, 

[Trackname: Weekend Wars]

Evil $, I, yes, to find a shore
A beast that doesn't quiver anymore
And we could crush some plants to paint my walls
And I won't try to fight in the weekend wars
Was I? I was too lazy to bathe
Or paint or write or try to make a change
Now I can shoot a gun to kill my lunch
And I don't have to love or think too much

Instant battle plans written on the sidewalk
Mental mystics in a twisted metal car
Tried to amplify the sound of light and love

Christ is cursed of fathers and martyrs
Might even take a knife to split a hair
Or even scare the children off my lawn
Givin' us time to make the makeshift bombs
Every mess invested was a score
We couldn't use computers anymore
But it's difficult to win unless you're bored
And you might have to plan for the weekend wars

Try to break my heart, I'll drive to Arizona
It might take a hundred years to grow an arm
I'll sit and listen to the sound of sand and cold
Twisted diamond heart, I'm the weekend warrior (huh)
My predictions are the only things I have
I can amplify the sound of light and love
I'm a curse and I'm a sound when I open up my mouth
There's a reason I don't win, I don't know how to begin
I'm a curse and I'm a sound when I open up my mouth
There's a reason I don't win, I don't know how to begin
I'm a curse and I'm a sound when I open up my mouth
There's a reason I don't win, I don't know how to begin
I'm a curse and I'm a sound when I open up my 

[Trackname: The Youth]

This is a call to arms to live and love and sleep together
We could flood the streets with love or light or heat, whatever
Lock the parents out, cut a rug, twist and shout
Wave your hands, make it rain, the stars will rise again

The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change? Are you?
Together, together, together
Together, together, together, together
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change? Are you?
Together, together, together
Together, together, together, together

In a couple of years, tides have turned from boos to cheers
And in spite of the weather, we can learn to make it together

The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change? Are you?
Together, together, together
Together, together, together, together
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change? Are you?
Together, together, together
Together, together, together, together

Together, together, together, together

[Trackname: Electric Feel]

All along the Western front
People line up to receive
She got the power in her hand
To shock you like you won't believe
Saw her in the Amazon
With the voltage running through her skin
Standing there with nothing on
She gonna teach me how to swim

I said, "Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel"
I said, "Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel"

All along the Eastern shore
Put your circuits in the sea
This is what the world is for
Making electricity
You can feel it in your mind
Oh, you can do it all the time
Plug it in, change the world
You are my electric girl
I said, "Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel"
I said, "Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel"

Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now
Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now
Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now
Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now
Do what you feel now!

[Trackname: Kids]

Five, four, three, two, one, ah!

You were a child crawlin' on your knees toward it
Makin' Mama so proud, but your voice is too loud
We like to watch you laughin'
You pick the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

The water is warm, but it's sendin' me shivers
A baby is born, cryin' out for attention
The memories fade like lookin' through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it

[Trackname: 4th Dimensional Transition]

I feel your racing heart
My liquid silver arms extended
These waves aren't far apart
Black gold in claw foot tubs unchanging

I am fire, where's my form?
Whisper crimson I intrude
There's light beneath your eyes
New overtones in view, endless form, endless time

If what they say is true
You are a shadow in the fourth dimension
To float away with you
We see the corners where nothing happens

While we drifted, we were one
Ceilings lifted walls were gone
You speak the language of the breeze
All your leaves were meant for me
The love that every person wants to be

Stuck together, I don't like revealing secrets
I'll live inside your lips if you won't laugh
My heaving hands on rotten fruit at last
Fallow fingers, there's a surface I can count on
She'd fit inside my heart and take it over
'Til her cape got blown into my red lungs
Either there's a purpose
Or I'm heading out at breakfast
Take a drink, take a drag
One more coffee, ugly hat
No more mirrors, woolen bag, and I am 

[Trackname: Pieces of What]

When the world has turned, paralyzed and wrong
Cold-blooded claws never offered anything at all
Past the point of love, shattered and untied
Waiting to pick up the pieces that make it all alright

But pieces of what?
Pieces of what?
Pieces of what
Doesn't matter anymore

Moonlight on my floor, shinin' through the roof
They got the city surrounded, as if I needed proof
I forgot my fear, feelings on the rise
Buried by all of the pieces fallin' from the sky

But pieces of what?
Pieces of what?
Pieces of what
We used to call home
Pieces of what
We used to call home
Lay my dragon's teeth and shallow water steel
At the Belgian gates, I waited for my 

[Trackname: Of Moons, Birds & Monsters]

Why'd you cut holes in the face of the moon base?
Don't you know about the temperature change in the cold black shadow?
Are you mad at your walls or hoping that an
Unknown force can repair things for you?
Pardon all the time that you've thrown into your pale gray garden?
If your ship will never come, you gotta move along

Even a bird would want a taste of dirt from abyssal dark
The prick of a feather could make a kingdom burn and the bloodshed start
The falling apart
Made me a shadow in the shape of wonder the waves of black
If she's going under, I can hold my breath 'til the sky comes back
Or drown like a rat, rat, rat
He's a rat


To catch a monster, we make a movie
Set the tempo and cut and cut its brains out
It will inspire on the burning pyre
Half the distance, half the motion
Communication is easy as the ocean


[Trackname: The Handshake]

I just shook the handshake, I just sealed the deal
I'll try not to let them take everything they can steal
People always told me, said, "Don't forget your roots"
I know I can feel them underneath my leather boots

You toss all the mornings lost to the clouds
And you watch it go
Your fair weather friends on a parachute binge
Get lost when the wind blows
The handshake's stuck on the tip of my tongue
It tastes like death but it looks like fun

I was a loner, I was just waiting by myself
When you, warped temptress, rose to bring me happiness and wealth
Black tears, black smile, black credit cards and shoes
You can call all the people you want, but it's you who's being used
Under your black eyes, honey, right beneath your nose
A curse on all creation, every single thing you know
White smoke, white light, white marble on the floor
It would only take a few seconds of darkness to figure out what's in store
Little girl

You convince yourself that you want it
But you don't know
You keep on tryin' to wash the blood from your hands
But it won't go
We're gonna keep you on the run
We got the handshake under our tongue
We got the handshake under our tongue
We got the handshake under our tongue
We got the handshake under our tongue
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the 

[Trackname: Future Reflections]

And there were future reflections
On the face and the hands
On a green-colored island
On a primitive man
It was the future reflecting
It felt familiar but new
A street was missing a building
The kids had something to do

There was a feeling the spirit was leaving
Red like a marker
So my tribe, with my knife
Cut the heart from a lonely life

I saw patterns on floorboards
Deep in the dust was a leader
Someone was walking on floorboards
Turning from oak into cedar
He can assess the situation
I wrapped a string around my finger
Into the forest with the young ones
I don't expect to be a winner
But as long as you feel it, I'm a believer
My heart is phosphor
Sea rolls and death tolls
Break the surface, don't break my bones
Off of the trail and off of your hands and
Onto a new plan
Is the cost to stay lost
Forever in an empty skin, pale and thin?

If it's good, or if it's fortune, I can't tell
But pieces come together for some reason, just as well
Their guns couldn't see us, there's a sea outside my door
And one day I'll appreciate the rush of blood and the washed-out beat of the shore

And remember what it felt like
To be alone
Sitting in the sunlight
All
