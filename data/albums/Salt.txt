[Trackname: Keep on Mixing]
I know how numb some types of life can make you feel
Left you wondering where your friends have gone
Wish I could fit somewhere, wishin for a station that fits my drive
Wish we could jump ahead
How backwards we have come
And I know and I know we're gonna get kicked down during the fight
And I know and I know that most of us are hurting inside
And it's hard when all sides think they're right
History loves to repeat
History lo- lo- lo- loves to repeat
Over and over, over and over, over and over in my mouth
Over and over, over and over, over and over in my mouth
How did it get so bad?
How did such ugliness stir up?
How can I say I'm free?
I've given you rights to keep on tracking me
And the eye in the sky will be watching down like a God up above
And I know that I saw some beauty around I must dig it up
Let you know if some turns up
I drop my head from time to time
I drop my head from time to time
As long as it knows it has to get back up
It can have the break from time to time
I know how numb some types of life can make you feel
The hatred thanks to fear is real
So just keep on mixing, mix all people
Soon enough and we'll all belong
Keep on mixing, mix all people
Swirl enough and we'll all belong
How did it get so bad?
How did such ugliness stir up?
How can I say I'm free?
I've given you rights to keep on tracking me

[Trackname: Alien FM]

You try slipping from what we have
See what welcomes you
Cause I see you try to anchor in our sanctuary
And leave it behind at the same time
When you feel the comfort of our time to come
A stillness is undone

Just go and wander
There in the sugarcanes

Alien FM, stale love
Interference again, stale love

I can never tell just what you're always thinking of but
It’s not me, repeatedly you're
Calling from a train
Or some other place
You lean our love on these with grace
Oh, I'm gonna lose you
I’m headed for the tunnel where we lose connection
Of another's brain, stale love
Stale love

'Cause you're crystal now
But there you'll be gone
You're crystal now
'Cause you're crystal now
But there you’ll be gone
You’re crystal now
You're crystal now

[Trackname: Koh-I-Noor]
Carry me on one shoulder
I have had too much
I'm let down
In a search for a financial cure
I've met rats
Reliant, trapped
What is good for me, doesn't pay
I'm a fake
So close to winning the game
Even closer to fooling heart
Haven't furniture, only fine clothes
To attract real wealth
Depthless, out of my element
Inside of my cage
It's when you're afraid but you
Don't know what you're afraid of
What is good for me, can not pay for me
I've been led astray
I'm let down, take me up
Caught my bluff
Make a fortune
Was the trick
Lured away
A place where things go together
Turns out it's a real thing

[Trackname: Buy to Return]
Buy to return
Buy to return
Every week
It gives you something to do
Something to prove
No one knows where you are, when you drive
Strapped in
Staring at a red light
Don’t you know what’s next to buy next week?
Line after line, never needed reasons
Line after line, any time of day
Next is your turn
No need for policy signs
You got them all memorized, you say
Hi Ruth, you have to help me
You never saw me here
Is it ever happening to you, when you’re
Staring at a red light
Don’t you know what’s next to buy next week?
What is all this white sugar
Torture in the whites of your eyes
Something to quit, or to take up
To change, or just leave behind
Staring at a red light
Staring at a red light
Don’t you know what’s next to buy next?
One last time
Nothing fits right
Dead on line
Ruth I need a change, need another size

[Trackname: Tops and Bottoms]

Tangled in my garments
Run out of space
Will i ever get to wear all of this?
Do I even like any of it?
Cheap shit

I never looked the way I pictured
The way I want

End up wearing the same old top and bottoms
There are some men I don't want looking at my parts
The same, same old top and bottoms
Day in, day out

Wish I could wear what I want to wear
Wishing to find what I want to wear
Then wishing to afford what I want to wear
What fits my boDy?
What fits a stick with a belly?

End up wearing the same old top and bottoms
There are some men I don’t want lookin' at my bottom
The same, same old top and bottoms
Day in, Day out
I just don't know what I’m doing
Some people really know a thing
I just can't feel what I'm doing
Some people really know a thing
Do I even like any of it?
Do I even like any of it?
Cheap shit

I never looked the way I pictured
The way I want, it's always strange
I try it on, it never works for me and
Will I ever stop looking for the right thing?

End up wearing the same old top and bottoms
Tangled up in the same old top and bottoms
Day 

[Trackname: Deseo]
Recorto una rama aquí
Pellizco una hoja
Giralo y mira el reflejo de un árbol
Para ver si está bien
Para ver cuánto tardará en repararse así mismo
Para lograr un aspecto mas natural
Espero que viva mucho tiempo
Eso es lo que deseo
Aplasto el pecho aquí
Aprieto la cintura
Giralo y mira el reflejo de una persona
Para ver si se ve bien
Para ver cuánto tiempo le llevará repararse así mismo
Para lograr un aspecto mas natural
Espero que viva mucho tiempo
Eso es lo que deseo

[Trackname: Taste in Movies]
Tell me I'm desensitized
Tell me porn is poisonous
That it dulls my pure desire
You don't know me
Or my taste
Taste in movies
Not so naïve
To expect my touch to mirror
Don't you borrow scenery
For your remnant city
Inner greys and greeneries
You don't know me
Or my taste
Taste in movies
Not so naïve
To expect my touch to mirror
You don't know me
Or my taste
Taste in movies
Not so naïve
To expect my touch to mirror
You don't know me
Or my taste
Taste in movies
Not so naïve
To expect my touch to 

[Trackname: Jaipur]

I'm losing my mind, searching for you
And, even if I found you, what would I do?
I would run from you

I'm not strong enough
Kind enough
I don't have the will
To believe enough

Help me be strong enough
Make my heart kind enough
It's not that I want for love
It's that I need to love

I'm losing my mind, searching for you
And, even if I found you, what would I do?
I would run from you

I'm not strong enough
Kind enough
I don't have the will
To believe enough
Help me be strong enough
Make my heart kind enough
It's not that I want for love
It's that I need to love

Help me be
Make my heart
It's not that I
It's that I
Help me be
Make my heart
It's not that I
It's that I

[Trackname: Set Me Free]
My mistakes are clearer
As my time here slips away
I'm scared of the mirror
I am trapped inside me
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
My life is a tight noose
That I tighten every day
The lies that I’ve used to deceive myself
Are getting deeper, deeper in my head
Is there a place for me where I can hide
From my eyes and my mind
Every pill I've ever tried
Tastes dull after a while
There's no rest for me when I sleep
Or I’d lie still for weeks
Now when I wake there's a pause
Then my mind knows it's still waiting for you to
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
Will there be peace for me when I die
Or will a piece of me still cry?
Waiting for another end
For the heat death to descend
Will I feel a chill on the night
When the last star's last light
Dims to nothing
And the darkness unfolds?
Is there time after death
Or does it freeze with my last breath?
Is the time till my death
Here as a test?
Or is it the only chance I have
To beg you to
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
Set me free
