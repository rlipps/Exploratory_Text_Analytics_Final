[Trackname: Barbie Nation]

Maybe when my womb is broken open and I can
Hold you with the joy of knowing there is no other
Fear will slip away and I can know that finally
Love is something I'll know
Always had the tendency to believe
Hiding from the truth could maybe set you free
After you dance that Hollywood mingle
Surrender yourself to the dream

I know you and me are not so much
I know you and me can make it far
But the bodies and lips moving
Hips sway, hearts drop
I know you and me are not so much
I know you and me can make it far
'Cause we're bred from Barbie Nation
We know pure elation, yeah

Suddenly within the little frame that I know
You'll grow into every corner shamed by the shadow
Sweetening the years when we grow together
Drinking all that TV glow
I can never shade you no, you will see
All the dark and lovely flow you will be
Stronger 'cause you'll always know the woman's weight
And happier than I'll ever be

I know you and me are not so much
I know you and me can make it far
But the bodies and lips moving
Hips sway, hearts drop
I know you and me are not so much
I know you and me can make it far
Cause we're bred from Barbie Nation
We know pure elation, yeah

I'd rather love you madly
Than divulge truth this sadly
We can continue facades
It's all fine and I know it's not for me
Despite all honesty here
Disputing kingdom failure
Just make your body nicer
Stand up taller, the world is watching you
Here
There
Where?
Where?

I know you and me are not so much
I know you and me can make it far
But the bodies and lips moving
Hips sway, hearts drop
I know you and me are not so much
I know you and me can make it far
'Cause we're bred from Barbie Nation
We know pure elation, yeah
I know you and me are not so much
I know you and me can make it far
But the bodies and lips moving
Hips sway, hearts drop
I know you and me are not so much
I know you and me can make it far
'Cause we're bred from Barbie Nation
We know pure elation, yeah

[Trackname: Happy With Me]

I can't wake up
See me running 'round the corner, move me up into the upswing
Call me undone
When I speak about the truth, I'm only brought up to the downbeat

It's not easy there
When you feel the wear
Patience brings the tear
Oh, oh, oh

Everyday do you notice that we're never free?
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Everyday we are running round trapped in our sea
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?

Pushing paper
I do everything I'm told and yeah I do it for the money
Understating
Every action that I take until I know there's something coming

It's not easy there
When you feel the wear
Patience brings the tear
Oh, oh, oh
Everyday do you notice that we're never free?
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Everyday we are running round trapped in our sea
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Everyday do you notice that we're never free?
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Everyday we are running round trapped in our sea
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?

The messages won't stop, they just keep pulling at you
Teasing us with the thought that better's something we'll do
If we could hold the tongue and focus all our time through
We would just rise above this cycle that we're bound to
(Everyday do you notice that we're never free?)
(Oh, why can't you be happy with me?)
(Everyday we are running)
(Everyday we are running)
(Everyday we are running)

Everyday do you notice that we're never free?
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Everyday we are running round trapped in our sea

Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Everyday we are running round trapped in our sea
Oh, why can't you be happy with me

[Trackname: Tell Me How It Is]

I found you in my dreams, running between the sheets
I follow touches from your fingers twisting all over my skin
I try for everything, to be your girl and king
Perfection never shines its light on me but still I chase the sun
We're always breaking through our love and what we do
'Cause when it happens off the screen it can't be right
You might be more than me, you say you want me free
You cannot know me, no you cannot

Tell me how it is
When you can go away
You know that there is everything I will not say
Tell me how it is
When you will know my face
You know that nothing scares me the way you scare me, now

I'm fighting with my mind along this lonely grind
Don't tell me truth, I'm running far so I don't even have to know
Remember when we met, I thought you'd never let
A broken girl like me run wild in your perfect little world
I don't believe you're true, I'm fighting all of you
To understand my plight against the shiny
I'll never trust it all, but boy it's not your fault
You cannot know me, no, you cannot
Tell me how it is
When you can go away
You know that there is everything I will not say
Tell me how it is
When you will know my face
You know that nothing scares me the way you scare me
Tell me how it is
When you can go away
You know that there is everything I will not say
Tell me how it is
When you will know my face
You know that nothing scares me the way you scare me, now

Can't you see there's something mad about us?
Birthing truth when nothing matters but lust
Don't be sure of what you see, oh no
I'm not sure of who we'll be, oh no
Can't you see there's something mad about us?

Tell me how it is
When you can go away
You know that there is everything I will not say
Tell me how it is
When you will know my face
You know that nothing scares me the way you scare me
Tell me how it is
When you can go away
You know that there is everything I will not say
Tell me how it is
When you will know my face
You know that nothing scares me the way you scare me, now

[Trackname: Money All Around]

Make me talk and set me free
Tell me who I'm meant to be
Fake originality
Everyone is nothing

Without resisting all the weak
Would we ever know we're able?
Give me something I can eat
I need your words I need your power
I have my money all around
Just take your clothes off, make me proud
I have my money all around
You look me up I'm crawling down

Little boy, I'll never see
Everything you mean to me
Keep you running on your feet
Let your head fall heavy

Without resisting all the weak
Would we ever know we're able?
Give me something I can eat
I need your words I need your power
I have my money all around
Just take your clothes off, make me proud
I have my money all around
You look me up I'm crawling down

And the time, oh the time, it's just running through
And I feel the weight of all we can do
You and me, oh I know there's nothing better yet
Say the words, take a chance you know you won't regret
And we try and we try but it's still the same
Judgement calls and I know that we can't be blamed
Oh, I'd leave it all if it weren't for you
Understand the fall if it weren't for you

I have my money all around
Just take your clothes off, make me proud
I have my money all around
You look me up I'm crawling down

I have my money
Just take your clothes off
I have my money
You look me up I'm crawling down
Money!
Money!
You look me up I'm 

[Trackname: Monumental Glow]

I know it's mine until
The day your head will fill
The little things they get me crazy
The only way you know me, baby
I'll shut my mouth as told
Leave judgment for the bold
We're only running just to catch up
Believing that we never fucked up

The monuments will show
We were meant for so much better
Betraying all the glow
Heavenly and held forever
Preceding eyes will hold
Fragments of the plastic gathered
Let go of the shame
They won't know the blame

I''ll lose myself in skies
Supporting all my cries
We'll stop the war and we'll just undress
It only matters when you're famous
It's frantic when you chose
Perception gripping you
I'm living for the hedonistic
It only matters when you risk it
The monuments will show
We were meant for so much better
Betraying all the glow
Heavenly and held forever
Preceding eyes will hold
Fragments of the plastic gathered
Let go of the shame
They won't know the blame

You go away, I know that I can call anytime
But hours shake the girl, making me unsure
I know that I can fumble the days
My words will slip all over the days
'Cause time is pushing through
And nothing's stopping you
So baby won't you hold up my hair
And tell me that you always will care
With bile on my lips and falling off in drips
The saddest part is living for one
When every moment we're told to run
And I'm not meant for this, retreating for the bliss

The monuments will show
We were meant for so much better
Betraying all the glow
Heavenly and held forever
Preceding eyes will hold
Fragments of the plastic gathered
Let go of the shame
They won't know the blame
The monuments will show
We were meant for so much better
Betraying all the glow
Heavenly and held forever
Preceding eyes will hold
Fragments of the plastic gathered
Let go of the shame
They won't know the 

[Trackname: Plastered Smile]

I'm always far below
The underdog that shows
Hold me together this time
And when I'm broken through
Retreating far from you
Try to remember it's fine
On all the lightest days
I slip beneath the haze
Of tighter bodies than mine
And while my eyes are true
They're always far from new
Don't blame yourself, we'll blame the time

It's always up, up, up
It's always mine
Argue for whatever this time
And so we wash our skin
So clean but not within
Plaster on your smile this time

My fate is up to those
Dictating beauty flows
I'll hide away until the night
And in the darkness pure
Our senses won't be sure
Relying only on the trite
Just sick of all the pain
And Puritan-like shame
That follows me into the light
This doesn't need to be
We could just all break free
Salvation lies beyond the fight
It's always up, up, up
It's always mine
Argue for whatever this time
And so we wash our skin
So clean but not within
Plaster on your smile this time

We're diving into all you say you know
Tied together still alone, darling
Frustrated and I know it's getting old
Jealous of the young and gold toys
Please tell me you agree with what you see
Lies are sweetest when we're not free
I'll say that I'm never affected when
Guilt is shaking up my head
Let me go

It's always up, up, up
It's always mine
Argue for whatever this time
And so we wash our skin
So clean but not within
Plaster on your smile this time
It's always up, up, up
It's always mine
Argue for whatever this time
And so we wash our skin
So clean but not within
Plaster on your smile this time

[Trackname: Best Friends]

Somehow every corner always calls up
Begging me to be the better or the best of
But I'd like to think it doesn't really matter
So let's drop it 'cause it doesn't really matter
Maybe I'll defy and it will fade out
Growing pale when no contrast can be made out
But I'd like to think it doesn't really matter
Let's just drop it 'cause it doesn't really matter

I have the best friends
Oh, watch my best friends
We'll never say the things they do
I have the best friends
We can't be boxed in
I'd rather flee than follow suit

Time will never let me take it back there
We can run 'cause you know that I will not care
Every action points to life beyond the reform
You know they'll forget about the before
All I want is just to spread all of the best love
Make you happy, make you realize you're the best of
Make you strong enough to do it for the reform
Maybe someday they'll forget about the before
I have the best friends
Oh, watch my best friends
We'll never say the things they do
I have the best friends
We can't be boxed in
I'd rather flee than follow suit

Moving up, moving down
Keeping diamonds on the rebound
Moving up, moving down
Will you ever come around?

Moving up, moving down
Keeping diamonds on the rebound
Moving up, moving down

Playing in pearls to pretend
I've got something better than
Drop the accent to assume the role
Lucky love is all I'm given
Got to keep on moving with it

Can I give you my car?
Can I give you my house?
Can I give you my high?
Do you know what I mean?
Is it really that mean?
Can we find some mean?
Moving up, moving down
Keeping diamonds on the rebound
Moving up, moving down
Will you ever come around?
Moving up, moving down
Keeping diamonds on the rebound
Moving up, moving down
Will you ever come around?

Antiquated measures hold
My body cannot be told
Keep it all together for your friends
Never had a class that I, I could call my own

Can I give you my car?
Can I give you my house?
Can I give you my high?
Do you know what I mean?
Is it really that mean?
Can we find some mean?

Moving up, moving down
Keeping diamonds on the rebound
Moving up, moving down
Will you ever come around?
(One, two, three...)
I'd give my dollars to hold you, you're powerful now
Didn't know it'd follow, we're living with it now
And feeding every doubt, it's all over soon
I'd give my dollars to
I'd give my dollars to
I'd give my dollars to

Moving up, moving down
Keeping diamonds on the rebound
Moving up, moving down
Will you ever come around?
Moving up, moving down
Keeping diamonds on the rebound
Moving up, moving down
Will you ever come around?

[Trackname: Regret You]

Won't you let me know you when the days are all gone?

It's like I never knew
That love was made by two
I scare myself by lusting for the harder dreamers
And after finding you
I see that now it's true
It's never what I'm told but how I chose to make it

Won't you let me know you when the days are all gone?
Sleeping on your shoulder while you're driving your car, yeah
Boy we ride forever when you're flying with me
Yeah I'll always let you know
Won't regret you when I go

You're sweetest when you see
This world is choking me
I always hold my breath and hope it will be over
Your hands upon my neck
This beauty and reflex
Let's transcend all the worst and find it while we're running
Won't you let me know you when the days are all gone?
Sleeping on your shoulder while you're driving your car, yeah
Boy we ride forever when you're flying with me
Yeah I'll always let you know
Won't regret you when I go

My heart breaks
For all the wasted time
The fire's just beginning
We're farther
There's nothing left but lust
We're primal no denying
Would you say that we are all believers
Of some deeper truth? Religion might redeem us and oh
I'll hold you
Until the night is done
Until the party's swaying

Won't you let me know you when the days are all gone?
Sleeping on your shoulder while you're driving your car, yeah
Boy we ride forever when you're flying with me
Yeah I'll always let you know
Won't regret you when I go
Won't you let me know you when the days are all gone?

I know I'm a weirdo, but you like the way I think
Faking it forever but we're honest as we sink
Won't you take me out for lunch?
Won't you spoil me undone?
Self-conscious and guilty, walking tired through the streets
I need your attention, need to know just what you see
Won't you eat me out at lunch?
Yeah just let me go I'm done

You make me so sick
When I see you standing there
Hold me closer, make me care
You make me so sick
When I see you standing there
Won't you leave me, then I'll care

I know I'm a loser, you don't have to play those games
Treat me all the same, you never seem to call my name
I know you need me out at night
I know you smile when I cry
Maybe I'm a sinner but I don't know other ways
Keep me all together tie my hands up when I say
Won't you eat me out at lunch?
Yeah, just leave me then I'll punch

When I see you standing there
Hold me closer, make me care
You make me so sick
