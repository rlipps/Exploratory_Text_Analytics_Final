Shake it like a ladder to the sun
Makes me feel like a madman on the run
Find me never, never far gone
So get your leather, leather, leather on-on-on-on

You're a zero
What's your name?
No one's gonna ask you
Better find out where they want you to go
Try and hit the spot
Get to know it in the dark
Get to know it whether you're a crime, crime, crime of love
Can you climb, climb, climb high up?

[Trackname: Heads Will Roll]

Off with your head
Dance 'til you're dead
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
On the floor

Glitter on the wet streets
Silver over everything
The river's all wet
You're all chrome

Dripping with alchemy
Shiver, stop shivering
The glitter's all wet
You're all chrome

The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, oh no
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, oh no
Oh, ah
Oh, ah
Off, off with your head
Dance, dance 'til you're dead (dead)
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
On the floor

Looking glass
Take the past
Shut your eyes
Mirror lies

Shut your eyes

Unknown
Talk to unknown
Ever
Lasts forever

Well, it's a sharp shock
To your soft side
Summer moon
Catch your shut eye
In your room
In my room
In your room
In my room

Louder
Lips speak louder
Better
Back together

Still, it's a sharp shock
To your soft side
Summer moon
Catch your shut eye
In your room
In my room
In your room
In my room
What's the time?

Love my name
Love left dry
Frost or flame

Fall asleep
Spin the sky

Soon comes rain
Dry your eyes
Frost or flame

[Trackname: Dull Life]

Want you to stay in a subtle way
Like you're walking again, all on me
Step slowly, you know that you fall between
Dark places, what a simple web we weave

We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in
We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in

Know my soul! Soul!
Know my soul!

Well, all hail the prison queen
Iron bars, iron heart
Iron bars, everything
A hundred years old
A hundred years old
Last on the village scene
Fall apart, iron heart
More alive than you've ever been
We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in
We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in

Well, it's a dull life, it's a dull life
It's a dull life, it's a dark place
It's a dull life, it's a dull life
It's a dull life, it's a dull life

Know my soul!

We've seen the nightmare of your lies
We've seen the nightmare of your lies
We've seen the nightmare of your lies
We've seen the nightmare of your lies
We've seen the nightmare of your lies
We've seen the nightmare of your lies

We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in
We've seen the nightmare of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie beneath is coming in
Know my soul

[Trackname: Shame And Fortune]

"Shame is soft," they say
Lose when I play your game
Come if you call my name
Lose when I play your game

You got an attitude
You got a way

All fortune on the floor
All fortune on the floor
All fortune on the floor
All fortune on the floor

"Shame is soft," they say
Lose when I play your game

All fortune on the floor

[Trackname: Runaway]

I was feeling sad
Can't help looking back
Highways flew by
Run, run away
No sense of time
Like you to stay
Want to keep you inside

Run, run, run away
Lost, lost, lost my mind
Like you to stay
Want you to be my prize

Run, run, run away
Lost, lost, lost my mind
Like you to stay
Want you to be my prize

I was feeling sad
Can't help looking back
Highways flew by
Run, run away
No sense of time
Like you to stay
Want to keep you inside
All alone
Not so strong without these open arms
Hold on tight
All alone
Not that strong without these open arms
Lie beside
All alone
Not so strong without these open arms
Lie beside

Run, run, run away
Lost, lost, lost my mind
Like you to stay
Want you to be my prize

Run, run, run away
Lost, lost, lost my mind

[Trackname: Dragon Queen]

My mouth is touching
Your mouth is running
No loving for nothing
Nobody, knock my body out

My mouth is blowing right up
I'm so gone
Incoming, out clubbing
Not loving, slow your body down

How my love going huh, huh?

[Trackname: Hysteric]

No longer, no longer
What you ask
Strange steps
Heels turned black
The cinders, the cinders
They light the path
And these strange steps
Take us back, take us back

Flow sweetly, hang heavy
You suddenly complete me
You suddenly complete me
Flow sweetly, hang heavy
You suddenly complete me
You suddenly complete me

Hysteric
Hysterical

No wonder, no wonder
Other half
Strange steps
Heels turned black
The cinders, they splinter
And light the path
And these strange steps
Trace us back, trace us back
Flow sweetly, hang heavy
You suddenly complete me
You suddenly complete me
Flow sweetly, hang heavy
You suddenly complete me
You suddenly complete me

[Trackname: Little Shadow]
Patience, shadow
For all your sight, there's no sight to see
Little shadow, little shadow
To the night, will you follow me?
Pardon, shadow
Hold on tight to your darkened key
Little shadow, little shadow
To the night, will you follow me?
Closer, shadow
For all your strikes, still, we're caught between
All this sorrow, little shadow
To the night, will you follow me?
Paler shade inside
Deeper deep, we dive
Turn and turn aside
To a fantasy
Little shadow
Into the night, will you follow me?
Little shadow
To the night, will you follow me?
