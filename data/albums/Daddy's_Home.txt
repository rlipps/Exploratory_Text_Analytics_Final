[Trackname: Pay Your Way In Pain]

(Ow)
Oh-oh-oh

You got to pay your way in pain
You got to pray your way in shame (Yeah, ow)

I went to the store, I was feelin' kinda hungry
But I didn't have the money and the shelves were all empty
So I went to the bank to ch-ch-ch-check my checking
The man looked at my face, said, "We don't have a record"
Oh no, you thought we had forgotten?
The show is only gettin' started
The road is feelin' like a pothole
Sit down, stand up, head down, hands up, and

Pay your way in pain
You got to pray your way in shame (Uh-huh)

Do you know what I want? (What do you want? What do you want?)
You know what I want (What do you want? What do you want?)
You know what I want (What do you want? What do you want?)
Keep the rest, baby, ah, ah
I wanna be loved
Pay, pain
Pray, shame
So I went to the park just to watch the little children
The mothers saw my heels and they said I wasn't welcome
So I, I went back home, I was feelin' kinda queasy
But all the locks were changed, my baby wouldn't see me
Oh no, you've put your finger on it
The stove is only gettin' hotter
The sun, it's gotta, gotta melt it
Stand up, sit down, hands up, break down

(What do you want? What do you want?)
You know what I want (What do you want? What do you want?)
I wanna be loved (What do you want? What do you want? Pay, pain)
I wanna be loved (What do you want? What you do want? Pray, shame)

[Trackname: Down And Out Downtown]

Last night's heels
On the mornin' train
It's a long way back downtown
Ten missed calls
They don't know where you are
It's a long way back downtown

Hey, I was flyin' (Flyin', flyin', flyin')
Over the Empire State (Over, away)
Then you kissed me (Kissed me, kissed me)
And I crashed again

When'd it start?
This feeling so wrong
When you're down and out downtown

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Bowery John
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Forgotten, but not gone
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Prayin' at St. Ann's
Bodega roses in my hands
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Down and out downtown
And the joker with that funny laugh
Is diggin' through the basement of my past
It's a long way back down
Down and out downtown

Hey, I was flyin' (Flyin', flyin', flyin')
Over the Empire State (Over, away)
Then you kissed me (Kissed me, kissed me, kissed me)
And I crashed again
Ooh-ooh-

[Trackname: Daddy's Home]

I signed autographs in the visitation room
Waitin' for you the last time, inmate

Daddy's home

You still got it in your government green suit
And I look down and out in my fine Italian shoes
And we're tight as a Bible with the pages stuck like glue
Yeah, you did some time, well, I did some time, too

Daddy's home

Ow
Ow
Ow

Daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home
Daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home

Well, all good Puritans, they'll pray about reform
You swore you had paid your dues, then put a PayDay into your uniform
We're all born innocent, but some good saints get scrеwed
Well, hell, whеre can you run when the outlaw's inside you?
Ow
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
(Daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home)
(Daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home)
Yeah
(Daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home)
(Daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home, daddy's home)
Daddy's 

[Trackname: Live In The Dream]

Hello
Do you know where you are?
You've been out cold
We almost called the cops
Don't get up
Can you count to ten?
Oh, boy, you're so lucky we found you when we did

'Cause there's a lot of people here who wanna do you harm
But stay with me, you fallen lamb
And I'll keep you in my arms

But I can't live in the dream
The dream lives in me

Welcome, child
You're free of the cage
Tryin' to seem sane makes you seem so strange
You look tired
Go on, rest your head
Oh, girl, you're so lucky we found you when we did
'Cause there's a lot of people here who wanna do you harm
But stay with me, you fallen lamb
And I'll keep you in my arms

But I can't live in the dream
The dream lives in me
Oh, I can't live in the dream
The dream lives in me

[Trackname: The Melting Of The Sun]

So sorry, missed the party
Hello, on the dark side of the moon
Jane lost it, crashed her Corvette
Ran into the tide in Malibu

And we all heard the gun
But I was slow to run

It's just the melting of the sun
(It's just the sun)
I wanna watch you watch it burn
(So watch it burn)

Saint Joni ain't no phony
Smoking Reds where Furry sang the blues
My Marilyn shot her heroin
"Hell," she said, "It's better than abuse"

So who am I tryna be?
A benzo beauty queen?
It's just the melting of the sun
(It's just the sun)
I wanna watch you watch it burn
(So watch it burn)
We always knew this day would come
(The day has come)
It's just the melting of the sun (Sun, sun, sun)

Brave Tori told her story
Police said they couldn't catch the man
And proud Nina got subpoenaed
Singing, "Mississippi, good goddamn"
But me, I never cried
To tell the truth, I lied

Girl, the world's spinning 'round
Spinning down and out of time
Girl, you can't give in now
When you're down, down and out
Girl, the world's spinning 'round
Spinning down and out of time
Girl, you can't give in now
When you're down, down and 

[Trackname: Humming - Interlude 1]

Listenin' in the kitchen
My mother fixin'
Something missin'
And all the while, she's hummin'

[Trackname: The Laughing Man]

9 , what's your emergency?)
I'm in love (I see, so how can I help you?)
I can hear the angels weepin'
So why do I feel like sleepin'?
Little birds, little birds
Chirp, chirp, chirp
Singin' like the day is perfect
But to me, they sound psychotic

I know you're gone, you left the scene
Heaven had more important things
But I can't sleep
I know you know exactly what I mean

If life's a joke, then I'm dyin' laughin'

Brown liquor
Why? Not sure
Like the heroines of Cassavetes
I'm underneath the influence daily
Remember when (Remember when)
We were kids? (Just kids)
Best of friends (Best of friends)
All grass stains and chicken dinners
Menthol mouths and secret stitches
Half-pipes and PlayStations
Suicidal ideation
I know you're gone, you dropped the scene
Left all of your guitars to me
But I can't play
I know you know exactly what I'm sayin'

If life's a joke, then I'm dyin' laughin'1

[Trackname: Down]

You've hit me one time
Imagine my surprise
When you hit me two times
You got yourself a fight
I was a patsy
You were a creep from the cheap seats
Thinking that my little scratch was like your big victory
See?
But I'll take you down, uh-huh

Tell me who hurt you
No, wait, I don't care to
Hear an excuse why you think you can be cruel
(Cruel, cruel, cruel)
Mama always told me
(Ooh, my mama told me)
"You got to turn the other cheek"
(Ooh, my mama told me)
But even she would agree, you're an exception to that rule
(Rule, rule, rule)

I'll take you (I will)
Yeah, I'll take you (I will)
I'll take you (Come on, baby)
I'll take you down
(I'll take you down, down, down, down)
I'll take you down
(I'll take you down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
Go get your own shit, get off of my tit
Go face your demons, check into treatment
Go flee the country, go blame your daddy
Just get far away from me

'Cause I'll take you down
(I'll take you down, down, down, down)
'Cause I'll take you down
(I'll take you down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
(I'll take you down)

Go tell your friends
Go tell your friends you're down
Run to your friends
If you got any left, you're down
Oh-oh-oh, run to your friends
Yeah, go tell your friends you're down
Oh-oh-oh, run to your friends
Ooh, if you got any left, you're 

[Trackname: Somebody Like Me]

Paint yourself white
Clip on the wings
Climb high to the top of a building
Does it make you an angel
Or some kind of freak
To believe enough
In somebody like me?
Baby

Oh, I (Oh, I), guess we'll see
Who was the freak

Dress up in white
Slip on the ring
Walk straight down the aisle
To the violin strings
Does it make you a genius or
The fool of the week
To believe enough
In somebody like me?
Baby

Oh, I (Oh, I), guess we'll see (I guess we'll see)
Who was thе freak
Time (Oh, I), tells us things (I guеss we'll see)
That you and I can't 2

[Trackname: My Baby Wants A Baby]

My baby loves me like a saint
My baby hates when I'm away
My baby wants a baby
How can I go on?

What in the world (What in the world)
Would my baby say?
"I got your eyes and your mistakes"
You make a home (You make a home)
I run away
And the story starts again
Then I couldn't stay in bed all day
I couldn't leave like my daddy
And I wouldn't be your only baby anymore

My baby's closer than a shave
My baby's blue when I dye greys
My baby wants a baby
How can it be wrong, wrong?
But I wanna play guitar all day
Make all my meals in microwaves
Only dress up if I get paid
How can it be wrong, wrong?

What in the world, what in the world would my baby say?
"I got your eyes and your mistakes"
I wanna run, I wanna run, I wanna chase
The еnding I can't see
Then I won't have no legacy
'Causе I won't write no symphonies
Won't have no streets named after me
Won't even have your sympathy
No one will scream that song I made
Won't throw no roses on my grave
They'll just look at me and say
"Where's your baby?

[Trackname: …At The Holiday Party]

At the holiday party
Red wine-lipped a little early
Reminiscin' got us laughin'
And that's when I saw your face crackin'

Smiles and smoke and screens
Your Gucci purse a pharmacy
Pretend to want these things
So no one sees you not gettin'

Not gettin' what you need, need
Need, need
You can't hide from me

Are you still workin' on your screenplay
Or did those lights go out on Broadway?
Think if you can just keep spinnin'
You won't miss what you've been missin'

Pills and JUULs and speed
Your little purse a pharmacy
And hide behind these things
So no one sees you not gettin'
Not gettin' what you need, need
Need, need
You can't hide, you can't hide from me

(You can't hide from me, you can't hide, you can't hide, no, you can't hide from me)
(You can't hide, you can't hide, no, you can't hide from me)
(You can't hide, you can't hide, no, you can't hide from me)
(You can't hide, you can't hide, you can't, you can't hide from me)
(You can't hide, you can't hide, no, you can't hide from me)
(You can't hide, you can't hide, you can't, you can't hide from me)
(You can't hide, you can't hide, no, you can't hide from me)
(You can't hide, you can't hide, you can't, you can't hide from me)
(You can't hide from me)
(You can't hide from me)

[Trackname: Candy Darling]

Candy Darling
Who knows why the caged bird even sings?
For high-priced lowlives
Red bodega roses, you and me

I never wanna leave
Your perfume candy dream

So, queen of South Queens
We never did stop cheerin' for you, babe
And your wig, blonde, rolls home
Wavin' from the latest uptown train

I never wanna leave
Your perfume candy scene

So, Candy Darling
I brought bodega roses for your feet
And Candy, my sweet
I hope you will be comin' home to me

[Trackname: Humming - Interlude 3]

In the park, she didn't show up
You take a high note and I'll join a chorus
And all my girls will keep humming
