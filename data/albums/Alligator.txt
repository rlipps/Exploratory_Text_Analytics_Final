[Trackname: Secret Meeting]

I think this place is full of spies
I think they're onto me
Didn't anybody, didn't anybody tell you?
Didn't anybody tell you how to gracefully disappear in a room?

I know you put in the hours to keep me in sunglasses
I know
And so, and now, I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
And now, I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain

I think this place is full of spies
I think I'm ruined
Didn't anybody, didn't anybody tell you?
Didn't anybody tell you this river's full of lost sharks?

I know you put in the hours to keep me in sunglasses
I know
And so, and now, I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
And now, I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain
(I'm talking ace this morning)

And now, I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way

It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way

[Trackname: Karen]

Karen, I'm not taking sides
I don't think I'll ever do that again
I'll end up winning and I won't know why
I'm really trying to shine here, I'm really trying
You're changing clothes and closing windows on me all the time

Well whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone into America
Whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone

Karen, we should call your father, maybe it's just a phase
He'll know the trick to get a wayward soul to change his ways
It's a common fetish, for a doting man, to ballerina on the coffee table cock in hand

Well whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone into America
Whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone

Without warm water in my head
All I see is black and white and red
I feel mechanical and thin
Hear me play my violin again
I'm living in the target's shoes
All I see is black and white and blue
Idle, idle, idle, idle, protect the nest, protect the title
Karen put me in a chair, fuck me and make me a drink
I lost direction and I'm past my peak
I'm telling you, this isn't me, no this isn't me
Karen believe me, you just haven't seen my good side yet

Well whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone into America
Whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone

Without warm water in my head
All I see is black and white and red
I feel mechanical and thin
Hear me play my violin again
I'm living in the target's shoes
All I see is black and white and blue
Idle, idle, idle, idle, protect the nest, protect the title

I must be me, I'm in my head
Black birds are circling my bed
I must be me, I must be me
Black feathers are falling on my feet
Idle, idle, idle, idle, protect the nest, protect the title
Idle, idle, idle, idle, protect the nest, protect the 

[Trackname: Lit Up]

My bodyguard shows her revolver to anyone who asks
And yeah, she comes to attention when you come up to me too fast
For a little while you'll be here, the only good part of me
For a little while you'll be here

So lit up, lit up, lit up alright
I try to untie Manhattan
Lit up, lit up, lit up alright
I try to untie

You wear your skirt like a flag
And everything surrounds you, and it doesn't fade
Nothing like this sound I make
That only lasts the season
And only heard by bedroom kids who buy it for that reason
'Cause you're the low life of the party, bad blood
Bad blood for everybody
I'm in control and I believe

So lit up, lit up, lit up alright
I try to untie Manhattan
Lit up, lit up, lit up alright
I try to untie from your bad blood
From your bad blood
'Cause you're the low life of the party, bad blood
Bad blood for everybody

So lit up, lit up, lit up, lit up alright
I try to untie Manhattan
Lit up, lit up, lit up, lit up alright

We're out looking for astronauts, looking for astronauts

It's a little too late, too late, too late for this
Isn't it a little too late for this?
Little too late, too late for this

We're out looking for astronauts, looking for astronauts
We're out looking for astronauts, looking for astronauts
Are we gone
Come on yeah, we know we're gone
Bye bye bye
Bye bye bye, we know we're gone
Take all your reasons and take them away
To the middle of nowhere, and on your way home
Throw from your window your record collection
They all run together and never make sense
But that's how we like it, and that's all we want
Something to cry for, and something to hunt
Are we gone
Come on yeah, we know we're gone
Bye bye bye

You know you have a permanent piece
Of my medium-sized American heart
So don't wear the watch
When you're out with the cunts
You can break what you have, but the rest of it's mine
Take all your reasons and take them away
To the middle of nowhere, and on your way home
Throw from your window your record collection
They all run together and never make sense
But that's how we like it, and that's all we want
Something to cry for, and something to hunt

[Trackname: Daughters of the Soho Riots]
I have your good clothes in the car
So cut your hair so no one knows
I have your dreams and your teethmarks
And all my fingernails are painted
I'm here to take you now
You were right about the end
It didn't make a difference
Everything I can remember
I remember wrong
How can anybody know
How they got to be this way?
You must have known
I'd do this someday
Break my arms around the one I love and be forgiven by the time my lover comes
Break my arms around my love
Break my arms around the one I love and be forgiven by the time my lover comes
Break my arms around my love
I don't have any questions
I don't think it's gonna rain
You were right about the end
It didn't make a difference
I'm here to take you now
Out among the missing sons and daughters of the Soho riots
Out among the missing sons and daughters of the Soho riots

[Trackname: Baby We'll Be Fine]

All night I lay on my pillow and pray
For my boss to stop me in the hallway
Lay my head on his shoulder and say
"Son, I've been hearing good things"

I wake up without warning
And go flying around the house
In my Sauvignon, fierce, freaking out
Take a forty-five minute shower and kiss the mirror

Say, "Look at me
Baby, we'll be fine
All we gotta do is be brave
And be kind"

I put on an argyle sweater and put on a smile
I don't know how to do this

I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
Baby come over, I need entertaining
I had a stilted, pretending day
Lay me down and say something pretty
Lay me back down where I wanted to stay

Just say something perfect
Something I can steal
Say, "Look at me
Baby, we'll be fine
All we gotta do is be brave
And be kind"
I pull off your jeans
And you spill Jack and Coke in my collar
I melt like a witch and scream
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything

Build a fire for Val Jester
Build a room for your love
Take your time when you tell her
How she lives in your blood

You should have looked after her better
You should have looked after her more
You should have locked the door

Fill her coat with weapons
And help her get it on
Cause one day when she goes
She's gone

You should have held onto her better
You should have held onto her more
You should have locked the door

I'm put together beautifully
Big wet bottle in my fist
Big wet rose in my teeth
I'm a perfect piece of ass
Like every Californian
So tall I take over the street
With high-beams shining up my back
A wingspan unbelievable
I'm a festival
I'm a parade

And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me

I'm a birthday candle in a circle of black girls
God is on my side
Cause I'm the child-bride
I'm so sorry but the motorcade will have to go around me this time
Cause God is on my side
And I'm the child-bride

And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me
I carry the dollhouse safe on my shoulders
Through the black city
Night lights are on in the corners
And everyone's sleeping upstairs
All safe and sound, all safe and sound
I won't let the psychos around
All safe and sound
I won't let the psychos around
