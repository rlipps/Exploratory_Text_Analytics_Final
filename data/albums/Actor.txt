[Trackname: The Strangers]

Lover, I don't play to win but for the thrill until I'm spent
(Paint the black hole blacker)
(Paint the black hole blacker)
And I threw flowers in your face on my sister's wedding day
(Paint the black hole blacker)
(Paint the black hole blacker)

You showed up with a black eye, looking to go start a fight
(Paint the black hole blacker)
(Paint the black hole blacker)
Playboys under the mattress, like I wouldn't notice
(Paint the black hole blacker)
(Paint the black hole blacker)

What do I share?
What do I keep from all the strangers who sleep where I sleep?

Desperate don't look good on you, neither does your virtue
(Paint the black hole blacker)
(Paint the black hole blacker)
Good souls have born better sons, better souls born worse ones
(Paint the black hole blacker)
(Paint the black hole blacker)
What do I share?
What do I keep from all the strangers who sleep where I sleep?

You showed up with a black eye, looking to finish a fight
And lover, I don't play to win but for the thrill until I'm spent
(Paint the black hole blacker)
(Paint the black hole blacker

[Trackname: Save Me from What I Want]

Keys are in my pocket and they
Watch your step
Rattle you away
Watch your step
Seventh floor apartment and a
Watch your step
Fiery escape, but
Watch your step
I'm a wife in watercolors
Watch your step
I can wash away what
Watch your step
Seventeen cold showers couldn't
Watch your step
Wash away

Save me, save me
Save me from what I want
Save me, save me
Save me from what I want

Honey, what reveals you is what you
Watch your step
Try and hide away
Watch your step
You could tell the planets or your
Watch your step
Pillowcase, but
Watch your step
I'm a wife in watercolors
Watch your step
I can wash away what
Watch your step
Seventeen cold showers couldn't
Watch your step
Wash away
Save me, save me
Save me from what I want
Save me, save me
Save me from what I want
Save me, save me
Save me from what I want
Save me, save me
Save me from what I want
Save me, save me
Save me from what I want
Save me, save me
Save me from what I 

[Trackname: The Neighbors]

Sister, say a prayer for us
One we learned from nuns and such
I won't believe, not a word you speak
Just make it sweet to hear
Let's pour wine in coffee cups
And drive around the neighborhood
And shine the headlights on houses
Until all the news is good

(Oh no!) What would your mother say?
(Oh no!) What would your father do?
(Oh no!) What would the neighbors think?
(Oh no!)

How am I supposed to sleep?
Roaming blackouts on the street
Oh, not a word, not another speech
We'll run the headlights down
These kids are foaming at the mouth
Psychotropic Capricorns
Tomorrow's some kind of strangerland
Where all the news is good
(Oh no!) What would your mother say?
(Oh no!) What would your father do?
(Oh no!) What would the neighbors think?
(Oh no!) If they only knew, knew

How can Monday be alright
Then on Tuesday, lose my mind?
Tomorrow's some kind of stranger
Who I'm not supposed to see

(Oh no!) What would your mother say?
(Oh no!) What would your father do?
(Oh no!) What would the neighbors think?
(Oh no!) If they only knew, 

[Trackname: Actor Out of Work]
You're a supplement, you're a salve
You're a bandage, pull it off
I can quit you, cut it out
You're a patient, iron lung
You're a cast-signed broken arm
You're an actor out of work
You're a liar and that's the truth
You're an extra lost in the scene
You're a boxer in the ring
With brass knuckles underneath
You're the curses through my teeth
You're the laughter, you're the obscene
You're a supplement, you're a salve
You're a bandage, pull it off
I think I love you, I think I'm mad
You're a cast-signed broken arm
You're an actor out of work
I think I love you, I think I'm mad
You're a boxer in the ring
With brass knuckles underneath
I think I love you, I think I'm mad

[Trackname: Black Rainbow]

There's a black rainbow above my house
Match the curtains and the floors
Think I'm glass, I think I'm breaking it
Wrecking ball outside the door

Let the children act like furniture
For the ladies of the lawn
But I can't see them, I can't see at all
Here, it's night time all the time

Bird outside the kitchen, fighting his reflection
Tell him I got nothing for him
Bird outside the kitchen, fighting his reflection
What's he going to win when he wins?

Unkissed boys and girls of paradise
Lining up around the block
Back pockets full of dynamite
While the neighbors talk and talk and talk

Bird outside the kitchen, fighting his reflection
Tell him I got nothing for him
Bird outside the kitchen, fighting his reflection
What's he going to win when he wins?
Throw the phone out the window
If you want the neighbors woke
You'll have to shout out loud
And set the bed alight and slow
If you want the neighbors woke
You'll have to shout even 

[Trackname: Laughing with a Mouth of Blood]

Just like an amnesiac trying to get my senses back
(Oh, where did they go?)
Laughing with a mouth of blood from a little spill I took
(What are you laughing at?)
See, I'll trade in my plot of land for a plane to anywhere
(Oh, where do you go?)
And I can't see the future but I know it's got big plans for me
(Oh, what does it see?)

All of my old friends aren't so friendly
All of my old haunts are now haunting me

Holed up at the Motel Ritz with a televangelist
(Oh, what did he say?)
At the bottom of a swimming pool with all the water out of it
(How'd you get in there?)
I'm sending consolation prizes to my next of kin, allies
(Oh, they'll be so thrilled)
And I can't see the future but I know it's watching me
(Wonder what it sees?)

All of my old friends aren't so friendly
All of my old haunts are now haunting me
Tell my sister that I miss her
Tell my brother that it gets much easier
Tell my sister that I miss her
Tell my brother that it gets much easier

All of my old friends aren't so friendly
And all of my old haunts are now haunting me
All of my old friends aren't so friendly
And all of my old haunts are now haunting 

[Trackname: Marrow]

Muscle connects to the bone
And bone to the ire and the marrow
I wish I had a gentle mind and a spine made up of iron

Mouth connects to the teeth
And teeth to the loves and the curses
Honey, can you reach the spots that need oiling and fixing?

H-E-L-P
Help me, help me
H-E-L-P
Help me, help me

Muscle connects to the bone
And bone to the ire and the marrow
So I pretend there aren't ten strings tied to all ten of my fingers

H-E-L-P
Help me, help me

If you want, we could go somewhere else
H-E-L-P
H-E-L-P
H-E-L-P
H-E-L-

[Trackname: The Bed]

We're sleeping underneath the bed
To scare the monsters out
With our dear daddy's Smith and Wesson
We've gotta teach them all a lesson

Don't move
Don't scream or we will have to shoot

Stop right where you stand
We need a chalk outline if you can
Put your hands where we can see them, please

We're holding up the lids of our eyes
And showing just the whites
"Mary, no one has such small hands
No, not the wind, not even that."

Don't move
Don't scream or we will have to shoot

Stop right where you stand
We need a chalk outline if you can
Put your hands where we can see them, please
Stop right where you stand
We need a chalk outline if you can
Put your hands where we can see them, 

[Trackname: The Party]

Honey, the party, you went away quickly
But oh, that's the trouble with ticking and talking
I lick the ice cube from your empty glass
Oh, we've stayed much too late
Till they're cleaning the ashtrays

Do you have change or a button or cash?
Oh, my pockets hang out like two surrender flags
Oh, but I'd pay anything to keep my conscience clean
I'm keeping my eye on the exit sign, steady now

How did we get here?
With creaks in these chairs
Oh, there aren't enough hands to point all the fingers
But I sit transfixed by a hole in your tee shirt
Oh, I've said much too much and they're trying to sweep up

[Trackname: Just the Same But Brand New]

The people in the street had overtaken you
By the time you rounded Second Avenue

So I walked away, all perfumed
Felt just the same but brand new

And anything you wrote, I checked for codes and clues
The letters stopped unceremoniously in June

So I changed my I's and A's to yours
I'm just the same but brand new

And I do my best impression of weightlessness now, too
And I might be wrong, I might be wrong, I might be wrong
But honey, I believed I could

Float away, dangling
I'm just the same but brand new to you

[Trackname: The Sequel]

Oh, honey, I was there in the dark where you lay
And I saw you with a scent on your hands
Going out to get you something

Oh, honey, I was there in the dark where you lay
And I saw you with a scent on your hands
Going out to get you something

One, two, three flight apartment street side
Bodies like wrecking balls fuck, fuck with dynamite
