[Trackname: Never Ending Circles]

Throw me
No more bones and I will tell you no lies
This time
At least I am not
So cold
You give me everything I never deserved
This time
You know I'll leave

Here's to taking what you came for
And here's to running off the pain
And here's to just another no man
If you want another, say you need another
Here's to never-ending circles
And building them on top of me
And here's to just another no man
If you want another, say you need another

Cut off
I'll go my way if I'm going at all
This time
Believe that the strong
Red lines
That I will draw will come and cover you up
This time
You know I'll leave
Here's to taking what you came for
And here's to running off the pain
And here's to just another no man
If you want another, say you need another
Here's to never-ending circles
And building them on top of me
And here's to just another no man
If you want another, say you need another

We are losing ground
It's time to save your neck
And I will try to find my feet and go
I am braced for words that never come
But I choose to decide
That I don't regret it, I don't regret it

Here's to taking what you came for
And here's to running off the pain
And here's to just another no man
If you want another, say you need another
Here's to never-ending circles
And building them on top of me
And here's to just another no man
If you want another, say you need 

[Trackname: Leave a Trace]

I gave up on time
Just like you said you would
There are tiny cracks of light underneath me
And you say I got it wrong
But I try hard to uncover them
I have somehow got
Away with everything
Anything you ever did was strictly by design
But you got it wrong
And I'll go anywhere but there

And you had best believe
That you cannot build what I don't need
And I know I need to feel relief
And I know you'll never fold
But I believe nothing that I'm told
And I know I need to feel relief

I know I need to feel released
Take care to tell it just as it was
Take care to tell on me for the cause
I know I need to feel released
Take care to bury all that you can
Take care to leave a trace of a man
I will show restraint
Just like we said we should
You think I'll apologise for things I left behind
But you got it wrong
And I'm as sane as I ever was
You talk far too much
For someone so unkind
I will wipe the salt off of my skin
And I'll admit that I got it wrong
And there is grey between the lines

And you had best believe
That you cannot build what I don't need
And I know I need to feel relief
And I know you'll never fold
But I believe nothing that I'm told
And I know I need to feel relief

I know I need to feel released
Take care to tell it just as it was
Take care to tell on me for the cause
I know I need to feel released
Take care to bury all that you can
Take care to leave a trace of a man
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know

I know I need to feel released
Take care to tell it just as it was
Take care to tell on me for the cause
I know I need to feel released
Take care to bury all that you can
Take care to leave a trace of a man

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I 

[Trackname: Keep You On My Side]

Everyone sees, but only I know
Nothing to lose, nothing to save to make a whole
What if I should make a loss?
Hold up both my hands, my fingers crossed
I don't sleep well, laying low
Never keepin' up, never lettin' go
What if I should look away?
Every human touch will be repaid

Without restraint
Within our veins

We bide our time, stay afloat
Keepin' the sun up off our bones
I never asked to know, never planned
'Til it was swept out of my hands
We bide our time, stay afloat
Keepin' the dying light exposed
I never asked to know, never lied
So I could keep you on my side

We feel the same
Without restraint
We feel the same
Within our veins
Everyone comes, but only I stay
Nowhere to look, nowhere to turn to fall away
What if I should call it off?
Hold up my demands with my heart uncrossed
I don't sleep well, laying low
Never keepin' up, never lettin' go
What if I should let it fade?
Every human touch will be repaid

Without restraint
Within our veins

We bide our time, stay afloat
Keepin' the sun up off our bones
I never asked to know, never planned
'Til it was swept out of my hands
We bide our time, stay afloat
Keepin' the dying light exposed
I never asked to know, never lied
So I could keep you on my side

We feel the same
Without restraint
We feel the same
Within our veins
We feel the same
(Payin' back all our chances, payin' back what we take)
Without restraint
(Payin' back all our chances, payin' back what we take)

[Trackname: Make Them Gold]

Can you tell me what to have and what to hold
If you never take the weight on your own?
No one tells us what is hard and what is fair
And we will deliver once we know where to fall

We are made of our longest days
We are falling, but not alone
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold
We are made of our smallest thoughts
We are breathing and letting go
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold

Can you steady all the hands that you hold
If you never look away from the drop?
If you push yourself, then I will pull you on
And we will deliver once we know where to fall

We are made of our longest days
We are falling, but not alone
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold
We are made of our smallest thoughts
We are breathing and letting go
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold
I will wait to see if you come at all
To stop us falling out of phase
Let's see if we can keep track of losing days
You smile so wide, I can see the sides
To stop us falling out of phase
I will be with you in the fray
With those second thoughts you asked for
All you asked for

We are made of our longest days
We are falling, but not alone
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold
We are made of our smallest thoughts
We are breathing and letting go
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold

And make them 

[Trackname: Clearest Blue]

Light is all over us
Like it always was
Like it always was
Shaped by the clearest blue
But it's not enough
It's not enough, not enough

Just another time I'm caught inside every open eye
Holding on tightly to the sides, never quite learning why
You'll meet me, you'll meet me
You'll meet me halfway
Whenever I feel it coming on, you can be well aware
If ever I try to push away, you can just keep me there
So please say you'll meet me
Meet me halfway

Tied to the shifting ground
Like I always was
Like I always was
You were the perfect storm
But it's not enough
It's not enough, not enough, not enough
Just another time that I go down, but you are keeping up
Holding to a hope you'll undermine, never to be reversed
Just another time I'm caught inside every open eye
Holding on tightly to the sides, never quite learning why
Whenever I feel it coming on, you can be well aware
If ever I try to push away, you can just keep me, tell me
Tell me, tell me you'll meet me
Tell me, tell me you'll keep me
Tell me, tell me you'll meet me
Will you meet me more than halfway up?

Shaped by clearest blue
Shaped by clearest blue
Shaped (Will you keep it half-a-way?) by clearest blue
(Will you keep it half-a-way?)
Shaped (Will you keep it half-a-way?) by clearest blue
(Will you keep it half-a-way?)

[Trackname: High Enough to Carry You Over]

No more barricades, slowly diffusing
I'll be leaving now, nobody's losing
If you could play your part, stay in resistance
Every fault would fade into the distance

Run if you like
All the mistakes that you left behind
Hold me down
You can't deny and I can't deny
Open your eyes
I'll look away and you come around
To build your words
High enough to carry you over

And I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up, me up
Then I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up, me up
No more clarity, only confusion
Every focused thought just an illusion
If I could see you now, if you would listen
Every fault would fade into the distance

Run if you like
All the mistakes that you left behind
Hold me down
You can't deny and I can't deny
Open your eyes
I'll look away and you come around
To build your words
High enough to carry you over

And I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up, me up
Then I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up, me up
And you are
If I only hadn't given you up
If you only hadn't given me up
And you are
If I only hadn't given you up
Losin' my breath and leavin' the rest

Run if you like
All the mistakes that you left behind
Hold me down
You can't deny and I can't deny
Open your eyes
I'll look away and you come around
To build your words
High enough to carry you over

And I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up, me up
Then I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up, me up
Then I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up, me up
Then I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up

[Trackname: Empty Threat]

Draw a line in the sand
Like there's nothing to regret and nothing to prove
Set my sights high enough
So I see the turning tides are parting for you

Taking back an empty threat
More than you could ever know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on
To try and not forget
Hoping that you never know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on

No more time second-guessed
Like there's nothing to forget and nothing to lose
Hold my ground long enough
'Til I see the turning tides are coming from you

Taking back an empty threat
More than you could ever know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on
To try and not forget
Hoping that you never know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
If we wanna stay here, can we see the waves?
They're spilling over us, filling our insides
In the rising water, in the rising tide
They're spilling over me, filling my insides
If we wanna stay here, can we see the waves?
They're spilling over us, filling our insides
In the rising water, in the rising tide
We wait for the fall (I gotta tell ya)
Maybe the water's high (I gotta tell ya)
But I can see the difference (I gotta tell ya)
Maybe the water's high (I got-got)
But I can see the difference (Got-got, I gotta tell ya)
Maybe the water's high (I gotta tell ya)
But I can see the difference (I gotta tell ya)
Maybe the water's high (I got-got)
But I know that this is different (Got-got)

Taking back an empty threat
More than you could ever know
Take it back with no regrets

[Trackname: Down Side of Me]

Maybe I
Could tell you that it's no big deal
Maybe I can aim this high
Or maybe I could eat my words

Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same

No more excuses and no more playing dead
There are no silver linings in anything you said
You could keep on denying and I could stay away
We could hold up our hands, say we don't want it, we don't need it

If I give more than enough ground, will you claim it?
I will take it all in one breath and hold it down
And if I try to pretend that I don't hear it
You can tell me to move and I won't go
You can tell me to try and I won't go
If I give more than enough ground, will you leave it?
I will take it all in one breath and hold it down

You can tell me to move and I won't go
You can tell me to try and I won't go

Cover up, cover up
Cover up that you're ruthless
Nobody, nobody
Nobody's ever gonna notice
And I am catching on and I am seeing red
How about I prove I'm right and raise it overhead?

I never promised you anything I couldn't do
We try to bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
You never promised me you would see it differently
Bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above

Reaching, reaching for
Reaching for my resistance
Nobody, nobody
Nobody sees it at a distance
And I am catching up and I am seeing red
How about I throw my weight and raise it overhead?
I never promised you anything I couldn't do
We try to bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
You never promised me you would see it differently
Bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above

All of the black and white
All of the contours
Are laid out before me now
To leave a trace
With all of the light and shade
We take up our own space
I'll find my own way back
Back to the past tense

A lifeline to highs and lows
To seeing the bright side and I should know
We wait for the afterglow
To cover the blind side and I should know

All of the empty thoughts
All of the outlines
Are laid out before us now
To leave a trace
All of your words and mine
They keep returning
I'll find my own way back
Back to the silence
A lifeline to highs and lows
To seeing the bright side and I should know
We wait for the afterglow
To cover the blind side and I should know

I've given up all I can
I've given up all I can
I've given up all I can
I've given up all I
