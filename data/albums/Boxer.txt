[Trackname: Fake Empire]

Stay out super late tonight
Picking apples, making pies
Put a little something in our lemonade
And take it with us

We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire

Tiptoe through our shiny city
With our diamond slippers on
Do our gay ballet on ice
Bluebirds on our shoulders

We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire


Turn the light out, say goodnight
No thinking for a little while
Let's not try to figure out everything at once
It's hard to keep track of you falling through the sky
We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire


[Trackname: Mistaken for Strangers]

You have to do it running
But you do everything that they ask you to
'Cause you don't mind seeing yourself in a picture
As long as you look far away
As long as you look removed

Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters
Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters

You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night
Under the silvery, silvery Citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes in eyes glazing under
Oh, you wouldn't want an angel watching over
Surprise, surprise, they wouldn't wanna watch
Another un-innocent, elegant fall
Into the un-magnificent lives of adults

Make up something to believe in your heart of hearts
So you have something to wear on your sleeve of sleeves
So you swear you just saw a feathery woman
Carry a blindfolded man through the trees
Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters
Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters

You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night
Under the silvery, silvery Citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes in eyes glazing under
Oh, you wouldn't want an angel watching over
Surprise, surprise, they wouldn't wanna watch
Another un-innocent, elegant fall
Into the un-magnificent lives of adults
You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night
Under the silvery, silvery Citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes in eyes glazing under
Oh, you wouldn't want an angel watching over
Surprise, surprise, they wouldn't wanna watch
Another un-innocent, elegant fall
Into the un-magnificent lives of 

[Trackname: Brainy]

I've been dragging around
From the end of your coat for two weeks
Everywhere you go is swirling
Everything you say has water under it
You know I keep your fingerprints
In a pink folder in the middle of my table
You're the tall kingdom I surround
Think I better follow you around

You might need me more than you think you will
Come home in the car you love, brainy, brainy, brainy

I've been dragging around
From the end of your coat for two weeks
You keep changing your fancy, fancy mind
Every time I decide to let it go
I was up all night again
Boning up and reading the American dictionary
You'll never believe me what I found
Think I better follow you around

You might need me more than you think you will
Come home in the car you love, brainy, brainy, brainy
You might need me more than you think you will
Come home in the car you love, brainy, brainy, 

[Trackname: Squalor Victoria]

Underline everything, I'm a professional
In my beloved white shirt
Underline everything, I'm a professional
In my beloved white shirt

I'm going down among the saints

Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor victoria, squalor victoria
Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor victoria, squalor victoria

Out of my league, I have birds in my sleeves
And I wanna rush in with the fools
Out of my league, I have birds in my sleeves
And I wanna rush in with the fools

Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor victoria, squalor victoria
Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor victoria, squalor victoria
I'm going down among the saints

3: in the last night for you to save this
You're zonin' out, zonin' out, zonin' out, zoning out
3: in the last night for you to save this
You're zonin' out, zonin' out, zonin' out, zoning out
This isn't working, you, my middlebrow fuck-

[Trackname: Green Gloves]

Falling out of touch with all my
Friends are somewhere getting wasted
Hope they're staying glued together
I have arms for them

Take another sip of them
It floats around and takes me over
Like a little drop of ink
In a glass of water

Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their loves

Cinderella through the room
I glide and swan
'Cause I'm the best slow dancer
In the universe

Falling out of touch with all my
Friends are somewhere getting wasted
Hope they're staying glued together
I have arms for them
Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their loves

Now I hardly know them
But I'll take my time
I'll carry them over
And I'll make them mine

Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their 

[Trackname: Slow Show]

Standing at the punch table, swallowing punch
Can't pay attention to the sound of anyone
A little more stupid, a little more scared
Every minute, more unprepared
I made a mistake in my life today
Everything I love gets lost in the drawers
I want to start over, I want to be winning
Way out of sync from the beginning

I wanna hurry home to you
Put on a slow, dumb show for you
And crack you up
So you can put a blue ribbon on my brain
God, I'm very, very frightened
I'll overdo it

Looking for somewhere to stand and stay
I leaned on the wall and the wall leaned away
Can I get a minute of not being nervous
And not thinking of my dick?
My leg is sparkles, my leg is pins
I better get my shit together, better gather my shit in
You could drive a car through my head in five minutes
From one side of it to the other
I wanna hurry home to you
Put on a slow, dumb show for you
And crack you up
So you can put a blue ribbon on my brain
God, I'm very, very frightened
I'll overdo it

You know I dreamed about you
For twenty-nine years before I saw you
You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for, for twenty-nine years
You know I dreamed about you
For twenty-nine years before I saw you
You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for, for twenty-nine 

[Trackname: Apartment Story]

Be still for a second while I try and try to pin your flowers on
La, la, la, la, la
Can you carry my drink? I have everything else
I can tie my tie all by myself
I'm getting tired, I'm forgetting why

Oh, we're so disarming, darling, everything we did believe
Is diving, diving, diving, diving off the balcony

Tired and wired, we ruin too easy
Sleep in our clothes and wait for winter to leave

Hold ourselves together with our arms around the stereo for hours
La, la, la, la, la, la
While it sings to itself, or whatever it does
When it sings to itself of its long lost loves
I'm getting tired, I'm forgetting why

Tired and wired, we ruin too easy
Sleep in our clothes and wait for winter to leave
But I'll be with you behind the couch when they come
On a different day just like this one
We'll stay inside 'til somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz for days
We'll stay inside 'til somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz
So worry not
All things are well
We'll be alright
We have our looks and perfume
Stay inside 'til somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz
So worry not
All things are well
We'll be alright
We have our looks and perfume 

[Trackname: Start a War]

We expected something, something better than before
We expected something more

Do you really think you can just put it in a safe
Behind a painting, lock it up and leave?
Do you really think you can just put it in a safe
Behind a painting, lock it up and leave?
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war

Whatever went away, I'll get it over again
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Whatever went away, I'll get it over again
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war

We expected something, something better than before
We expected something more

You were always weird, but I never had to hold you
By the edges like I do now
You were always weird, but I never had to hold you
By the edges like I do now
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war
Whatever went away, I'll get it over again
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Whatever went away, I'll get it over again
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war

Walk away now and you're gonna start a 

[Trackname: Guest Room]

They're gonna send us to prison for jerks
For having vague ideas of the way to turn each other on again
They're gonna send us to prison for jerks

They'll find us here
Here, here in the guest room
Where we throw money at each other and cry
Oh, my

We miss being ruffians, going wild and bright
In the corners of front yards, getting in and out of cars
We miss being deviants

They'll find us here
Here, here in the guest room
Where we throw money at each other and cry
Oh, my

We can't stay here
We're starting to stay the same
We can't stay here
We can't stay this way
Just tie your woman to your wrist
Give her the room to tie the other

They'll find us here
Here, here in the guest room
Where we throw money at each other and cry
Oh, 

[Trackname: Racing Like a Pro]

You're pink, you're young, you're middle class
They say it doesn't matter
Fifteen blue shirts and womanly hands
You're shooting up the ladder

Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my god, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my god, it was a million years ago

Sometimes you get up and bake a cake or something
Sometimes you stay in bed
Sometimes you go "la-di-da-di-da-di-da-da"
Until your eyes roll back into your head

Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my god, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my god, it was a million years ago

You're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know
You're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know
Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my god, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my god, it was a million years ago

You're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know
You're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know

You're dumbstruck, 

[Trackname: Ada]

Ada, don't talk about reasons why you don't wanna talk
About reasons why you don't wanna talk
Now that you got everybody you consider sharp
All alone, all together, all together in the dark

Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all
Up in the air

Ada, put the sounds of your house in a song
Try to be speechless for a minute
If you think you're gonna faint, go out in the hallway
Let them all have your neck
Ada, don't stay in the lake too long
It lives alone and it barely knows you
It'll have a nervous breakdown and fall
Into a thousand pieces around you

Stand inside an empty tuxedo with grapes in my mouth
Waiting for Ada
Ada, hold onto yourself by the sleeves
I think everything counts a little more than we think
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all
Up in the air

Ada
Ada
Ada
Ada, I can hear the sound of your laugh through the wall


Ada, don't talk about reasons why you don't wanna talk
About reasons why you don't wanna talk
Now that you got everybody you consider sharp
All alone, all together, all together in the dark

Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air

Ada

Ada, I can hear the sound of your laugh through the wall

Ada, I've been hoping you know your way 

[Trackname: Gospel]

One, two, three, four

I've got two armfuls of magazines for you, I'll bring 'em over
So hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
Hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
And I'll, I'll bring a nice icy drink to you

Let me come over, I can waste your time, I'm bored
Invite me to the war every night of the summer
And we'll play G.I. blood, G.I. blood
We'll stand by the pool, we'll throw out our golden arms

Darling, can you tie my string?
Killers are calling on me

My angel face is falling
Feathers are falling on my feet
Darling, can you tie my string?
Killers are calling on me

Stay near your, stay near your television, set it up outside
And hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
Hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
And I'll, I'll bring a nice icy drink to you
Let me come over, I can waste your time, I'm bored
Invite me to the war every night of the summer
And we'll play G.I. blood, G.I. blood
We'll stand by the pool, we'll throw out our golden arms

Darling, can you tie my string?
Killers are calling on me

My angel face is falling
Feathers are falling on my feet
My angel face is falling
Feathers are falling on my feet

Darling, can you tie my string?
Killers are calling on me
Darling, can you tie my string?
Killers are calling on
