Jodi
Please turn the pages for me
You seem so free
You know I'm barely, barely
Wrap me in silk
I want to drink your milk
You hold the key
You know I'm barely, barely
Parker Lake Beach
All of the sunnys swimming
I wanna see
To feel my body sinking, sinking
She gives me gills
Helps me forgive the pills
She makes me sing
She is both dreamer and dream
And dream, and dream, and dream

[Trackname: UFOF]

To my UFO friend
Goodbye, goodbye
Like a seed in the wind
She's taking up root in the sky
See her flickering
Her system won't even try
To defend and ripen
In the radio action

She'll never return again
Polarize, polarize
The seasons will bend
There will soon be proof
That there is no alien
Just a system of truth and lies
The reason, the language
And the law of attraction

Just like a bad dream
You'll disappear
Another map turns blue
Mirror on mirror
And I imagine you
Taking me outta here
To deepen our love
It isn't even a fraction
Switch to another lens
The last sunlight
I don't need any other friends
The best kiss I ever had is the flickering
Of the water so clear and bright
To leap in, my skin
And I could feel the reaction

Just like a bad dream
You'll disappear
Another map turns blue
Mirror on mirror
And I imagine you
Taking me outta here
To deepen our love
It isn't even a fraction


Just like a bad dream
You'll disappear
Another map turns blue
Mirror on mirror
And I imagine you
Taking me outta here
To deepen our love
It isn't even a 

[Trackname: Cattails]

Caroline, Caroline
I never could leave you to struggle
Hold the line, hold the line
I’ll be there on the double
In time, in time
Everyone does see trouble

And you don’t need to know why when you cry
You don’t need to know why
You don’t need to know why when you cry

Violet’s eyes, Violet plays
Going back home to the Great Lakes
Where the cattail sways
With the lonesome loon
Riding that train in late June

With the windows wide by my side
With the windows wide
With the windows wide by my side

And the clusters fell like an empty bell
Meteor shower at the motel
Where the empty space is a saving grace
Making good time and doing well
Still the question sings like Saturn’s rings
Maybe she knows and she won’t tell
But you don’t need to know why when you cry
You don’t need to know why
You don’t need to know why when you cry

And I find you there in your country flair
Middle of the river in a lawn chair
With your wrinkled hands and your silver hair
Leaving here soon and you know where
To where the cattail sways with the lonesome loon
You’ll be riding that train in late June

With the windows wide by your side
With the windows wide
With the windows wide by your side
You don’t need to know why
You don’t need to know why when you 

[Trackname: From]
No one can be my man, be my man
Be my man, be my man
Be my man, be my man
No one can be my woman, be my woman
Be my woman
One ear to the ground
One dog at my neck
One tongue to my tongue
Wanting to protect me from, from
No one can be my man, be my man
Be my man, be my man
Be my man, be my man
No one can be my woman, be my woman
Be my woman
One ear to the floor
My dog barking loud
Couldn't tell for sure
Where the screaming sound
Was coming from, from
One ear to your womb
Puppy on the floor
Baby’s coming soon
Wonder if she'll know
Where she's come from, from
From, from
From, from

[Trackname: Open Desert]

Vacant angel, crimson light
Darkened eyelash, darkened eye
The white light of the living room
Leaking through the crack in the door
There was never need for more
Things we're meant to understand
Crawling closer to your hand

To the poison image
Brave surrender
Kiss the water

After all my teeth are gone
After all the blood is drawn
The white light of the waiting room
Leaking through the crack in the door

Through the poison image
Brave surrender
Kiss the water

Through the mirror, mountain view
She has one green, one eye blue
I can see her smiling through
The white light of the living room
Leaking through the crack in the 

[Trackname: Orange]

Orange is the color of my love
Fragile orange wind in the garden
Fragile means that I can hear her flesh
Crying little rivers in her forearm
Fragile is that I mourn her death
As our limbs are twisting in her bedroom

Lies, lies, lies
Lies in her eyes
Lies, lies, lies
Lies in her eyes

She tells me to close and count to ten
As she wanders freely through the forest
Can I close and open once again?
The question that I seek for reassurance

Lies, lies, lies
Lies in her eyes
Lies, lies, lies
Lies in her eyes
Hound dogs crowing at the stars above
Pigeons fall like snowflakes at the border
She kneels down and holds the frozen dove
The moon drips like water from her shoulder

Flies, flies, flies
Flies from her eyes
Flies, flies, flies
Flies from her eyes

Orange is the color of my love
Fragile orange wind in the garden
Fragile means that I can hear her flesh
Crying little rivers in her forearm
Fragile is that I mourn her death
As our limbs are twisting in her bedroom

[Trackname: Century]

Dogs eyes in the headlights of the driveway
Cool autumn rain
Bugs died on your windshield on the freeway
Wonder if you'll be the same
Centuries flower

And we have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power

Moth flies in the window of the kitchen
You hang up your coat
Cold lips and gold eyes listen
There's something that I want you to know
Turn on the shower

'Cause we have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power
No resolution, no circling dove
Still caught in the jaw of confusion
Don't know what I'd do for love
But stay another hour

'Cause we have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same 

[Trackname: Strange]

Doesn't it seem strange
Searching for a hidden page
The fairy’s cage
Coming of true age
Leave the costume on the stage
The silkworm's rage
Iridescent thread, beautiful and dead
Billions of worms were boiled to make the bed

Strange, see the luna moth cry
Lime green tears through the fruit bat's eyes

Scatter and destroy
Every power you enjoy
To lay with the void
Twirling of the dime, splitting of the mind
Drawing constellations ’til the stars align

Strange, see the luna moth cry (Cry)
Lime green tears through the fruit bat's eyes (Eyes)

You have wings of gold
You will never grow old
And turquoise lungs
You have never been young
You have wings of gold
You will never grow old
And turquoise lungs
You have never been young

[Trackname: Betsy]

Driving through the night
Rings of crystal, crystal light
Every gulp of the warm suburb air
Betsy's auburn, auburn hair

Ooh, ooh

Drive into New York with me
How she keeps me calm
Street lights, boys and poison palms

Ooh, ooh

Drive into New York with me
Big lights in the city

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, 

[Trackname: Terminal Paradise]

Warm
So warm
Screaming in the field
As I was born
Worm
Will you return me
To the robin's beak?
I'll be a bird

Terminal
We both know
Let the rest of me go
See my death become a trail
And the trail leads to a flower
I will blossom in your sail
Every dream and waking hour

Woman
Woman
Hold me in your heat
'Til I remember

Terminal
We both know
Let me rest, let me go
See my death become a trail
And the trail leads to a flower
I will blossom in your sail
Every dream and waking hour

[Trackname: Jenni]

Too hot to breathe
Too hot to breathe
Too hot to breathe

Jenni's in my room
Jenni’s in my room
Jenni's in my room

Her skin so bare
The fragrant air
Her vacant eye

Jenni's in my room
Jenni’s in my room
Jenni's in my room

The signal swarms
The portal forms
She calls me through

Jenni's in my room
Jenni's in my room
Jenni's in my room
Jenni's in my room
Jenni's in my room
Jenni
Jenni's in my room

[Trackname: Magic Dealer]

Starve, magic mirror
I thought the crumbs of your life wouldn't dry
It hurts to see clearer
Falling like needles, the passage of time

Would it hurt, would it hurt to be nearer?
Heaven is stitching across me
My chest is the crossing
The blood is parting all the time, but I don't mind

Carve magic dealer
Bring me the company I couldn't buy
As I go cleaner
Falling like needles, the passage of time

Would it help, would it help to go deeper?
I am the photograph in you
The photograph in you
Still as the moment we're lying in right now
