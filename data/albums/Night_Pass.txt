[Trackname: Thin Growing Thing]

I wear a ring
For each thin growing thing
In each thin growing thing
You can feel it, yeah, you can feel it
In green and gray
In sunshine and in shade
In starlight and in rain and in the sharpest blade, you can feel it

You can feel it, yeah, you can feel it
You can feel it, yeah, you can feel it
You can feel it, yeah, you can feel it, yeah

My lonely dove
I know it hurts, it does
But no, there is no love without the lovers
Without the lovers
Sent from above
Yeah, I know it fucks you up
But what else can you trust if you can feel it? Yeah, you can feel it

You can feel it, yeah, you can feel it
You can feel it, yeah, you should feel it
You can feel it, yeah, you should feel you should lift for love
Lift for love and live for something
Lift for love and live through something
Lift for love and live through something else

My lemon light

If it's all that you can find then you should feel it, yeah, you should feel it

You can feel it, yeah, you can feel it

[Trackname: Devotion]

I am the great pretender
For as long as I can remember
With fortunes of forward motion
And visions of growing orchards
But white moon strings they found me
And she wrapped her arms around me
And she wrapped her arms around me
And she whispered she said

Darling devotion
It puts stars in the jewels
And darling devotion
It's all we can do

I am the dusty diamond
I sparkle and shine in silence
A thousand times I've tried it
Just to let it slip behind me
But your time span orbit found me
And you wrapped your arms around me
And you wrapped your arms around me
And you whispered you said
Darling devotion
It puts stars in the jewels
And darling devotion
You know it's all we can do
Yeah we can do it

We put the stars in the jewels
Yeah put the stars in it
You wrapped your arms around me
And you whispered you said

Darling devotion
It puts stars in the jewels
And darling devotion
It’s all we can do
Yeah we can do it

Because it’s me and you
Yeah, it's me and you
C'mon, it's me and you
Yeah, it's me and you
Because it’s me and you putting stars in the jewels
Just me and you putting stars in the jewels
'Cause me and you putting stars in the jewels
Just me and you putting stars…

[Trackname: Veil]

She swayed a star in limbo
Above the holy sea
To drop a diamond from her window
And when they found them in the shallows
They were rockin' real close
'Cause they couldn't feel the shadow

But all the best is just the rest of
Just the rest of forgive and forget
All the best is just the rest of

Now in the midnight shallow
She'll wear a vapor veil
To remember what she had oh
She'll breathe a rhythm in the shadows
She'll dream him nights of black and gold
At least I heard somebody said so

But all the best is just the rest of
Just the rest of forgive and forget
All the best is just the rest of
Don't forget love it's a test love
When the best of forgive is forget
Don't forget love in your chest love
In the shadows yes there's a best love
Don't forget love it's a test love
When the best of forgive is forget
Don't forget love in your chest love
In the shadows yes there's a best love

Don't forget love it's a test love
Don't forget love
Don't forget love

[Trackname: Black Starling]

All the lonely sole survivors of markets of the ghosts
Obsidian only where magma is exposed
Where the world is wide
With wonders worth the roam
Wild watcher in the night
Sing until you melt the stone sing

Blue in the islands
Blue in the sky
Daddy don't cry it's just a bump in the night

Black starling white violet
Don't leave the palace silent
Stream in stars and tears wands and pentacles
Let me light you like a candle
I will light you
Black starling white violet

Lonely lovers in the keyhole lonely lovers on the run
Bones in cranium shakespearean
Dedicated dedicated dedicated ones
Don't think twice what's done it's done sing
Blue in the islands
Blue in the sky
Daddy don't cry it's just a bump in the night

Black starling white violet
Don't leave the palace silent
Stream in stars and tears wands and pentacles
Let me light you like a candle
I will light you
I will light you like a candle
Let me light you
Black starling white violet

Oh please daddy don't
All alone all alone all alone
Oh please daddy don't cry it's just a bump in the night

Black starling white violet
Don't leave the palace silent
Stream in stars and tears wands and pentacles
Let me light you like a candle
I will light you
Black starling white violet
Don't leave the palace silent
Stream in stars and tears wands and pentacles
Let me light you like a candle
I will light you
(Lonely lovers all survive lonely lovers all survive all alone)
I will light you like a candle
Let me light you
(Lonely lovers all survive lonely lovers all survive all alone)
Black starling white violet
I will light you like a candle
Let me light you
Black starling white violet

[Trackname: Ad Victoriam]

Come kings come casting
Come hearts of peridot
Come cast into the stone
Come oceans crashing
We're everlasting hymns
And ad victoriam

And ad victoriam
And on and on and on
And ad victoriam
And on and on

You children see it
All chariots all gold
All harmony heroes
When five rings five circles
As five stars above become
Five moons to light the sun

Beyond the ocean stream
All sleeping silence
And in an exit
There's light that's all night lasting long
And on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on
And ad victoriam
And on and on and on
And ad victoriam
And on and on
And ad victoriam
And on and on and on
And ad victoriam
And on and on and on

[Trackname: All Night]

Dark nights and blackest dreams
When nothing's ever as it seems
And you are all alone
And what's left in between
When creepers pick your stitches clean
And you are all alone

But there's one thing they can't keep
This twilight kiss from me

All night I'll run with you
'Til black in the sky turns blue
Yeah all night I'll run with you
'Til black in the sky turns

Late nights and starless stones
When there's no moon to lead you home
And you are all alone
But these nights they live in me
And I have clever energy
And you are not alone
But watch them run and hide
When I light the lightning shrine

All night I'll run with you
'Til black in the sky turns blue
Yeah all night I'll run with you
'Til black in the sky turns
'Til black in the sky turns

All night I'll run with you
'Til black in the sky turns blue
Yeah all night I'll run with you
'Til black in the sky turns
All night I'll run with you
'Til black in the sky turns blue
Yeah all night I'll run with you
'Til black in the sky turns

'Til black in the sky
Yeah all night
'Til black in the sky
I'll be with you all night
'Til black in the sky

[Trackname: Moonrise]

Now who's the most desired?
And who's the most admired?
Do you want to take it higher?
Do you need to feel invited?
Did you know that I'm a spider?
And I weave it in the midnight
'Cause the silver lies inside me
I cross my web to kiss the sunrise
I cross my web to kiss it

Remember what I said
Yeah I crawl across my web

At night I'm just as quiet
In my iridescent fiber
Through the lattice creeping higher
Across my web to kiss the moonrise
What you want you've never tried I
And I know you're undecided
But I think they'll find you crying
With your head and heart divided
Your head and heart divided
Remember what I said
I crawl across to kiss the sunrise
Yeah I crawl across my web
I crawl across to kiss it

Your head and heart divided, dead, dead, dead, dead
Remember what I said
I crawl across to kiss the moonrise
Yeah I crawl across my web
Your head and heart divided, dead, dead, dead, dead
Remember what I said
I crawl across to kiss the sunrise
Yeah I crawl across my web
I crawl across to kiss it

[Trackname: Remember]

I'll be around
I’ll be around
Right by the pathway to the pond
To the forest underground, I'll be around
My heart, my pendant
You're all that I depend on
If it’s enough, if it's…

Remember Gemini in June
Remember all she promised you
And when she fit you like a glove
And then was not enough

In selenite, I've seen through
The only way I can see you
It's not enough, it's not enough
In skyways and in canyons
I've searched for my companion
On wings of love always

Remember Gemini in June
Remember all he promised you
And when he fit you like a glove
But then was not enough
Can you believe in make-believe?
Can you believe in things that you can't see?
Can you believe in make-believe?
Can you believe?

Remember Gemini in June
The mellow golden condor moon
And when she fit you like a glove
And then was not enough
Remember light that leaves a star
It has to travel very far
As always Gemini in June
Remember I'll come back to you

Believe in make believe
I want you to believe in things that you can’t see
Can you believe in make-believe?
I want you to believe in things that you can’t see
Can you believe in make-believe?
I want you to believe in things that you can't see
Can you believe in make-believe?
I want you to believe in things that you can’t see

[Trackname: Joyous Lake]

Pisces and Aquarius
Cap and Sagittarius
In the heavens up above
Above the joyous lake
I will not be jealous of
Night ships that are sailing
In stream lit skies mysterious
Above the joyous lake

All in line
All in time
All in line

Enrica, Angelina
Clara, Mary, Sarah
Wild red roses on their sails
Petals for the night pass
The joyous won’t be jealous of
Night ships that are sailing
In stream lit skies mysterious
Above the joyous lake

All in line
All in time
All in line
All in line
All in time
All in line
And I
I’m not afraid
All in line
All in time
All in line
And I
I’m not afraid, no

[Trackname: Violet a Voyager]

Violet a voyager
There's nothing that you should hide
Alone in a violet sky
When voyage is in exile
Afraid of what lays behind
The places where phantoms hide
The black in the violet sky
A pass to the other side

Beam immer immer
As phantom orchids lay
As violet finds its way above the moonlight shade

Violet a voyager
There's nothing that you should hide
Alone in a violet sky
When voyage is in exile
Through tides in the violet isles
There's wind in your sails at night
A pass to the other side
Through black in the violet sky

Beam immer immer
Through caverns in the sea
And dream of simple things, the silver maple tree
What dreams give back again
At night beneath the waves
As violet finds its way above the moonlight shade
Becomes an endless song
A place to mark as new
Formed silent and intense will always be that way

Will always be
Like light beneath
Will always be
Like light beneath
Will always
Above the moonlight shade
Beneath the silver waves
Will always
Above the moonlight shade
Beneath the silver waves
Will always
Above the moonlight shade
Beneath the silver waves
Will always
