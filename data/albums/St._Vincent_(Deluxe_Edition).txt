[Trackname: Rattlesnake]

Follow the power lines back from the road
No one around, so I take off my clothes
Am I the only one in the only world?

I see the snake holes dotted in the sand
As if Seurat painted the Rio Grande
Am I the only one in the only world?

Sweating, sweating, no wind whipping behind me
Sweating, sweating, no one will ever find me

The only sound out here is my own breath
And my feet stuttering to make a path
Am I the only one in the only world?

Is that the wind finally picking up?
Is that a rattle sounding from the brush?
I'm not the only one in the only world

Running, running, running, rattle behind me
Running, running, running, no one will find me
Running, running, running, rattle behind me
Running, running, no one will ever find me
Sweating, sweating, sweating, rattle behind me
Running, running, no one will ever find me
Sweating, sweating, sweating, rattle behind me
Running, running, no one will ever find 

[Trackname: Birth In Reverse]

Oh, what an ordinary day
Take out the garbage, masturbate
Ha, I'm still holding for the laugh
The dogs will bark, so let them bark
The birds will cry, I'll let them cry
Here's my report from the edge

Like a birth in reverse
What I saw through the blinds
You could say that I'm saying
Phenomenal lies
On the cosmic eternity
Party line
Was a birth in reverse
In America


This tune will haunt me through the war
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha
Laugh all you want, but I want more
'Cause what I'm swearing, I've never sworn before
Like a birth in reverse
What I saw through the blinds
You could say that I'm saying
Phenomenal lies
On the cosmic eternity
Party line
Like a birth in reverse
In America


Like a birth in reverse
What I saw through the blinds
You could say that I'm saying
Phenomenal lies
On the cosmic eternity
Party line
Was a birth in reverse
In 

[Trackname: Prince Johnny]

Prince Johnny, you're kind, but you're not simple
By now, I think I know the difference
You wanna be a son of someone

Remember the time we went and snorted
That piece of the Berlin Wall that you'd extorted
And we had such a laugh of it?
Prostrate on my carpet

You traced the Andes with your index
And bragged of when and where and who you're gonna bed next
All with sons of someone's
All with sons of someone's

Saw you pray to all to make you a real boy
Saw you pray to all to make you a real boy

Prince Johnny, you're kind, but do be careful
By now, I know just when to stand clear
When all your friends and acolytes
Holding court in bathroom stalls
Where you pray to all to make you a real boy
Saw you pray to all to make you a real boy

But honey, don't mistake my affection
For another spit-and-penny style redemption
'Cause we're all sons of someone's
We're all sons of someone's
I wanna mean more than I mean to you
I wanna mean more than I meant to him

So I pray to all to make me a real girl
So I pray to all to make me a real girl

So I pray to all
All
All


[Trackname: Huey Newton]

Feelings, flash cards
Fake knife, real ketchup
Cardboard cutthroats
Cowboys of information
Pleasure dot loathing dot Huey dot Newton
Oh, it was a lonely, lonely winter

Fuckless pawn sharks
Toothless, but got a big bark
Live children, blind psychics
Turned online assassins
So Hale-Bopp, Hail Mary, hail Hagia Sophia
Oh, it was a lonely, lonely winter

Entombed in a shrine of zeros and ones
You know, you know
Oh, with fatherless features, you motherless creatures
You know
Oh, in perpetual night, oh, it's terribly frightening
You know, you know
Oh, you got the pop and the hiss in the city of misfits
You know
Safe, safe and safest, faith for the faithless
Oh, dim, dim and dimmer, succor for sinners
I'm entombed in a shrine of zeros and ones
You know, you know
Oh, with fatherless features, you motherless creatures, you know, hey
Oh, in perpetual night, oh, it's terribly frightening
You know, you know
You got the pop and the hiss in the city of misfits
Oh, safe, safe and safest, faith for the

Get back, gnashing teeth
Ooh

People turn the TV on, it looks just like a window
Yeah

So I stopped sleeping, yeah, I stopped sleeping
Won't somebody sell me back to me?

[Trackname: I Prefer Your Love]

I, I prefer your love to Jesus
Little baby on your knees 'cause the world has got you down

Name-tagged tourists, sick at the sight of them
Tight-walking the sidewalk in spite of them
As my headache moves from east to west
Mother, won't you open your arms and
Forgive me of all these bad thoughts?
I'm blinded to the faces in the fog

But all the good in me is because of you
It's true

I, I prefer your love to Jesus
I, I prefer your love to Jesus
Little baby on your knees 'cause the world has got you down

King-sized country wearing your worries out
Headless heroes heaped by the pylons
As a careless sun sets on the west
Sure as mother licking her finger to
Wipe the blush and smudge from my cheek and
Wonder what will become of your little one
But all the good in me is because of you
It's true

I, I prefer your love to Jesus
I, I prefer your love to Jesus
Little baby on your knees 'cause the world has got you 

[Trackname: Regret]

Morning, pry the windows open
Let in what's so terrifying
Summer is as faded as a lone cicada call
Memories so bright, I gotta squint just to recall
Regret the words I've bitten
More than the ones I ever said

Who's the one animal?
All by yourself, all of us

All of us, all of us


Who's the one animal?
All by yourself, all of us
Who's the one animal?
All by yourself, all of us

I'm afraid of Heaven because I can't stand the heights
I'm afraid of you because I can't be left behind
Oh well, there's a red moon rising
The door slammed and it felt like a cannonball

Who's the one animal?
All by yourself, all of us
Who's the one animal?
All by yourself, all of us

All of us, all of 

[Trackname: Bring Me Your Loves]

Bring me your loves, all your loves, your loves
I wanna love them too, you know
Bring me your loves, all your loves, your loves
I wanna love them too, you know
Bring me your loves, all your loves, your loves
I wanna love them too, you know

I, I took you off your leash
I, I took you off your leash
But I can't, no, I can't make you heel
Bring me your loves
Bring me your loves
We both have our rabid hearts
Feral from the very start
So bring me your loves, all your loves, your loves

[Trackname: Psychopath]

Running down the highway like a psychopath
All the flames and fury, honey, at my back
Wanna make a bet whether I make it back?
'Cause I'm on the edge of a heart attack

You said, "Honey, quit your worrying
Distance is exactly like a blowing wind
Putting out the embers and the tiny flames
And keeping the big ones burning"

So I am standing in the sand where we said
"It's the best day of my life," and meant all of it

Keep me in your soft sights
When all of the rest have moved on
And I'll keep you in my soft sights
When all of the crowd has gone home


Keep me in your soft sights
When all of the rest have moved on
And I'll keep you in my soft sights
When all of the crowd has gone home

[Trackname: Every Tear Disappears]

Oh, a smile is more than showing teeth
Oh, it's not the potion, it's the magic that I seek

Every tear disappears
Every tear disappears

Oh, the more that I struggle, oh, the deeper in the pit
If I can show a hand, then I can show a fist

Call the twenty-first century
Tell her, "Give us a break"

Every tear disappears
Every tear disappears

Oh, and what about the pain?
Don't ask me how, I just know that it fades
Hey, hey, hey

Every tear disappears
Every eye is a seer, oh
Yeah, I live on wire
Yeah, I've been born twice
Yeah, I live on wire
Yeah, I've been born twice
Yeah, I live on wire
Yeah, I've been born twice
Yeah, I live on wire
Yeah, I've been born twice
Yeah, I live on wire
Yeah, I've been born 

[Trackname: Severed Crossed Fingers]

When your calling ain't calling back to you
I'll be side-stage mouthing lines for you
Humiliated by age, terrified of youth
I got hope, but my hope isn't helping you

Spitting our guts from their gears
Draining our spleen over years
Find my severed crossed fingers in the rubble there

Wake up puddle-eyed, sleeping in a suit
The truth is ugly, well, I feel ugly too
We'll be heroes on every bar stool
Seeing double beats not seeing one of you

Spitting our guts from their gears
Draining our spleen over years
Found my severed crossed fingers in the rubble there

Well, you stole the heart right out my chest
Changed the words that I know best
Found my severed crossed fingers in the rubble there
Holding on and on, holding on and on
Holding on and on, on and on
Holding on and on, holding on and on
Holding on and on, on and on
Enough, enough, enough, enough
Enough, enough, enough, enough
Enough, enough, enough, enough
Enough, enough, enough, enough

Spitting our guts from their gears
Draining our spleen over years
Find my severed crossed fingers in the rubble there

Well, you stole the heart right out my chest
Changed the words that I know best
Find my severed crossed fingers in the rubble 

[Trackname: Bad Believer]

What do you know?
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?

From the nave and down unto the altar
I left my momma sitting in the pew
Knelt before the trembling pastor
Fainted as he touched my trembling hand

What do you know?
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?
Show me your stones
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?

Momma held me up through the rapture
Dragged me through the eyes and the whispers
Lost my spirit out the car window
Batted by righteous, righteous hands
What do you know?
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?
Show me your stones
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?

But now I'm not afraid
I know that love is stranger
Held up and writhing in the light
No, I'm not ashamed
There really is no danger
Give me life
Give me life
Give me life

What do you know?
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?
Show me your stones
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?
Show me your stones
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?

[Trackname: Pieta]

Baptized in the shallow end
Of a Holiday Inn
Limbs dangled over my Pa
Like an inverse Pietà

Mother Nature cried
"You are Leviathan, my child
You are Leviathan inside"

And my lungs runneth over
With chlorinated water
And I pleaded with my Pa
But he said, “I can’t carry you no more”

Mother Nature cried
"You are Leviathan, my child
You are Leviathan inside"
Mother Nature sighed
"What hell is this I made this time?
You are Leviathan in size"

Can I make a pet of you?
Dress you up for all the girls
Will I keep you begging now
Or touch you with my gentle words?
Mother Nature cried
"You are Leviathan, my child
You are Leviathan inside"
Mother Nature sighed
"What hell is this I made this time?
You are Leviathan in size

[Trackname: Sparrow]

No eyes are on the sparrow, eyes are on the sparrow
He is singing anyway
The lark keeps whistling his number, silly little number
Although he’s being chased
And no eyes are on the sparrow, eyes are on the sparrow
How could that be the case?
The lark keeps whistling his number, silly little number
As if he isn't prey

And they’re calling Maria
Momma, Momma Maria
They’re calling Maria

No eyes are on the sparrow, eyes are on the sparrow
I could’ve told you that
The finch is gathering the branches
Ignoring all the chances the wind will blow it flat

And they’re calling Maria
Momma, Momma Maria
They’re calling Maria

[Trackname: Del Rio]

We were down on 10th
You told me I looked spent
Gave that look you give
And rushed me to the river

Del, Del Rio
Del, Del Rio

We filled our cups
Drank to drinken up
Then when we were done
We threw ourselves in the river

Del, Del Rio
Del, Del Rio

Getting some strange looks back from the shore
And you, you pinched my arm
Said, "Look who's lucky now"
And you, you saved my life
Too many times to count
Del, Del Rio
Del, Del
