[Trackname: Fantasy]
Close your eyes and picture me
Draw my face and make me breathe
I’ve got something that you know you need
I’ll lift you up I’ll put you on your knees
Play me in your head and run it back
As I whisper to you on the track
Turn me up until you hit the max
Slow it down, let your mind relax
I want to be your fantasy
Change the world with how and what you see
Our desire’s your identity
Locks you up but it could set you free
Fantasy becomes reality
Chase me up and down imagined lanes
Feel your mind and feel my body strain
Let me help you get to know your pain
I’m in your heart I’m racing through your veins
I want to be your fantasy

[Trackname: Expressions]

All this waiting
Wanting you
And I love how it feels
When you’re coming near, getting near
I spent up all my time lonely
You are in my head
So could you hurry please getting here

I’m looking forward to this
No more falling back
I’m dying for your touch
My heart beats faster
Obsessed

You didn’t die
You didn’t leave
For tonight you’re coming home with me
You didn’t mind
No begging please
You made the trip
You’re coming home to me

This time apart you’ve been in my private thoughts
But can it work?
What has distance done to us?
You’re almost here, wings flutter all through me
My heart beats faster with thoughts of you taking me in my head
So could you hurry please, getting here
When you’re coming here
Been looking forward to us
No more holding back
I’m dying for your touch
My heart beats faster
Obsessed

You didn’t die
You didn’t leave
For tonight you’re coming home with me
You didn’t mind
No begging please
You made the trip
You’re coming home to me
You didn’t die
You didn’t leave
For tonight you’re coming home with me
You didn’t mind
No begging please
You made the trip
You’re coming home to me

Dreams
Can it be?
Are you real?
You’re coming home with me
You didn’t die
You didn’t leave
Did you eat?
You’re coming home with me

Can you see me?
Pulled up on the street?
Can you see me?
Pulled up on the street?

[Trackname: Youth Obsessed]
It's widespread
And so common
Humans are youth obsessed
The people want the youngness
No interest
For experienced
That youthfulness
Is a global fetish
Looked over
Indifference
When the person feels complete
Already found a new you
Adolescence will work for less
Trade and experience
Easily influenced
They're wanted before they've changed
The figure must be fresh
If their act's not raw
Without a second guess
People say “step down”
Why they still at it?
When they still look good
More hate towards the women
That's showbiz
They will invest
With the promise
That the star is tender
Mature skill just as attractive as somebody new
Developing skills
Don't let the man only feed you one face
When plenty still
Doing what they want
They once were young
And had your eye
Will you be ignored when you're fully grown?
They once were young
And had your ear
Humans are youth obsessed
It's a global fetish

[Trackname: Carmen]
Espero que no tenga nada que ver conmigo
Y estoy tratando de mantener el enfoque en ti
Todavía te estoy extrañando
Pero no creo que me extrañes igual
Libérame, pero espero que nunca lo hagas
¿Te lastimé?
Espero que no sea nada de lo que hice
¿Cómo se supone que debo sentirme?
Corriendo al agua, corriendo más lеjos de mí
Todavía te estoy еxtrañando
Pero no creo que me extrañes igual
Libérame, pero espero que nunca lo hagas
Elle es tierne
Elle es hermosa
Pero elle no lo cree así
Te fuiste tan rápido y lejos de mi
Todavía te estoy extrañando
Pero no creo que me extrañes igual
Libérame, pero espero que nunca lo hagas
¿Te lastimé?

[Trackname: Beezle]
The days are dark and so am I
A ruin on a cliff
A desolate rock
No one to care for
Separate from the world
Center of existence
No desire for a friend
Cold boulder of the small blue devil
Disruption, a break in the pattern of torment
The days are dark and so am I
A ruin on a cliff
A desolate rock
Iʼve been exposed
A peek at goodness
A tremor in my heart with desire for a friend
Donʼt know how to reactWhen youʼre sweet, Iʼll push it back
My nature is untamed
Iʼm all I know I canʼt give you comfort
I can only take
Youʼll run away and Iʼll mope while longing
My nature is untamed
Iʼm all I know I canʼt give you comfort
I can only take
Iʼll scare you off but I wish youʼd return
Cold boulder of the devil of solitude
Accepting your velvet kiss of torment

[Trackname: Ballarino]

Doesn’t matter what I think
I’ll let you do that on my behalf
Gonna go wherever you take me
My head needs a break from doing all that

I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go when my Ballarino texts me

You help me get what I crave
I’m gonna let you take the wheel
Gonna do whatever you tell me
'Cause I know that you’ll help me feel so good

I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go when my Ballarino texts me

I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me

From now on
You are the one
Looking out for me
You are a tiny star
That fell into my everyday
In sync eternally
Ballarino Ballantine
Always be with me

I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna go where my Ballarino takes me
I just wanna
I just wanna
I just wanna go
I just wanna
I just wanna
I just wanna go
Ballarino Ballantine
Held up in front of me
Ballarino Ballantine
Held up in front of me

[Trackname: Polvo]
Pequeños pedazos de todo, flotando
Me están mareando
Es asqueroso pero también asombroso
Fragmentos
De nuestro mundo
Que se acumulan
En nuestras casas
Y son transportados al mar
Polvo
Viento
Agua
Vital
Juega un papel en nuestro clima
Es lo suficientemente poderoso como para alimentar al océano
Puede hacerte sentir enfermo
También puede transportar la contaminación
El polvo alimenta al fitoplancton y el fitoplancton nos da oxígeno
Polvo
Viento
Agua
Vital
Cualquier cosa podría estar en еl polvo
Una semilla y los muertos
Fragmentos
Dе nuestro mundo
Que se acumulan
Polvo
Viento
Agua
Vital
Cualquier cosa podría estar en el polvo
Una semilla y los muertos

[Trackname: Diary]

You should write it down
Depending how you feel
You should type it up
All depends on how you feel
Could be fun for later
It might help you out
Or make a lot of trouble
It all depends

Capture all your moods
Could be fun for later
Burst out into tears
You feel so bad
Then you write it down
Gets your head on level
That’s another entry
Taking daily notes

Protect, protect as best you can
In the physical and the digital
Express, express as best you can
When you’re in a mood, try to get it down
Try to get it down
Might forget

You write it all down
You write it all down
You write it all down
Might forget

Today was earthly heaven
Not a single fight
Tonight was feeling spooky
We heard a ghost
In dark I feel a sadness
Another day is finished
Repeat of daily habits
All in my report

You might like it
You might hate it
Try to no let anyone take it
If it’s private, protect as best you can
Express, express as best you can
Try to get it down
Might forget

[Trackname: Despoil]
There's always been a limit to the demolition
A different direction or left for ruin
You see the resistance with what must be changed
It’s been made clear, there's way too much at stake
Coincide with the air, fall in love with the sea
A doom is awaiting unless we undo our damage
We've built to fall apart but never to degrade
If we can’t improve, then we will devastate
Not all can afford sustainable life
Priced high for the rich but we all lose
And into the dirt with useless coins
Or evolution and improve
More value than coin is the living world
Reject that it's happening
It can't heal itself
It won't go away
Despoil
Or save
Power to destroy, with strength to restore
We exist now, our future selves left unsure
There's always been a limit to the demolition
A better direction or left for ruin

[Trackname: Al Mundo Azul]
Voltea a la estrella al mundo azul
I've felt blue
Pero la luna seguirá saliendo
Las nubes pasarán y un azul bonito se sienta por encima de todo
Voltea a la estrella al mundo azul
I've felt blue
Pero la luna seguirá saliendo
Las nubes pasarán y un azul bonito
Estoy solo y responsable de mí mismo
I'm forced to grow up fast
No quiero caer debajo del azul
Así que seguiré cuidando de mí mismo y de lo que amo
