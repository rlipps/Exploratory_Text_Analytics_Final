[Trackname: Company]
You used to tongue cracks in the glass, lioness and Pyramus
Model scale set of your room, carrot kiss, issue sweet moss from the dust
Do you appreciate my company?
Bled red and black, royal hand. Soiled hand with tuning peg
Fingers caught in his device, noumena for to talk about yours, tentacle draped on the leg
But what will it take for you to appreciate my company?

[Trackname: Tenderize]
In my spot, the rooms go on for miles, like emerald -racks
Does that resonate with you?
At the junction, I have heard it said that those rooms are for two eyes
So does it come as a surprise that I’ve seen it two times?
Feeling all the things that you have tenderized
The double door shuts on my step, and I’ve seen it 2 times
(What you gonna do with that big black eye?)
Down in Madrid, we’ll be the hound dogs on the stage, eyeing Northern flesh
Their kingdom in the snow and its yellow constitution
Feeling all the things that you have tenderized
The double door shuts on my step, and I’ve seen it 2 times

[Trackname: Steve Polyester]
I was lying in the shade where the dandelions grow
And asphalt is hollow and the rocks are broken down and brown
A not so popular part of town
We'd heard he was witty...
We'd seen signs of it all around the city
The people said
"Doo doo doo doo..."
“He's a landscape.”
“He's like a ruby lined in gold.”
“Yeah, shaped like a cockroach.”
"He smells good.”
These notions were hazy
Ordinary, a bit lazy
I was swinging on a branch outside, catching a ride when my resolve swelled
I will find him, I will
I have momentum still
Then I fell into an anthill
And the people said, "Doo doo doo doo..."
They carried me back to my doorstep
The sun was in my eyes...
But I saw him
I saw him a friend, a friend
I found in him a friend, a friend
And he went by the name of Steve Polyester
He said, “I am a landscape. (YEAH.)
I am a ruby lined in gold (YEAH), shaped like a cockroach
I smell good.”
He was a landscape
Nonetheless, he would escape
But, it was for the best
This town will never be the same
Why'd he have to go?
Who is there to blame?
And the people said, "Doo doo doo doo..."
I saw him a friend, a friend
In him a friend, a friend
He started walking
He went farther than he ought to have gone
He went farther and farther
Until he was gone
He was a landscape
Come back

[Trackname: Roses and Cherries]
It was in my way, it was in my way
What changed?
If you heat the conversation, then I’ll keep it warm
Roses and cherries, it’s you that keeps me up
Will the ruby fabric retreat to the brush?
Will her circlet come undone in the rush?
I don’t make these rules!
If you wanna heat the conversation, then I’ll keep it warm
And if you feel in the inclination, then I’ll fill your cup
With roses and cherries, it’s you that keeps me up

[Trackname: Coat Of Shellac]
Made of wanting, solely, I’m used to - it’s easy, look at what we gain
Sorta holding on loose ever so slightly, fingers feeling rain
And if it’s over will you wanna go, I’m down
If you account for me and vouch for me every time we go...
Will you surrender to a remedy so ripe it’s running cold?
Push in to fix, to get it set
Pushing to feel the very half
And it counts as an echo when we get out
Never one not only, no not like the TV, whittle it away
Sorta novel to stay largest and heavy, mountain full of clay
And if it’s over will you wanna go, I’m down, you know that I’m down

[Trackname: Black Dog]
So I stopped
A black dog on the hill
I was in her home
I burrow through the leaves
If you want, we can see the empty house
Through the forest clearing
She lurks in quiet corners
And I will touch her brow

[Trackname: Best Hexagon]
I sat in the Babel of the humors
On one occasion
Will you relieve me of the burden
For a while?
You might be shocked
And if we sit for the conversation
You might be shocked
At what you see
We’ll save it for the morning
Let’s find a cozy hexagon
We’ll curl up in the stacks
Supper with the have-nots, learn to keep my trap shut, chew on gummy snacks

[Trackname: Billz]
Test it
Otis weak to bear our weight
Kicks on nine and caps on eight
Don’t hold for me
I’m a mandrake
Land for lease to rot: “so shrill!”
Thread too bare to grip these hills
Will it educate me?
Will it elevate me?
But, is it gonna pay my bills?
Who's gonna pay my bills?
NO, NO, NOT ME!
And for fashion
I’ll stop and spray the flowerpot
A scent too sweet for second thought
Will it elevate me?
Oooooh, will it educate me?
Oh, I know, oh, I know
Is it gonna pay my bills?
Who's gonna pay my bills?
Oh, no, not me!
No, no, not me!
Cause I’ve made up my mind
I will find one small moment
And I’ll text you
And I’ll fact-check every reference that I make
Learn the language to impress you
Cause I’m yours
And if you tell me that you’re mine
You’re the one I’m getting next to...
But our love ain’t gonna pay my bills

[Trackname: Victoria]
Victoria
I told you that I needed you
But now it’s time to let you go
You’re everything that I need
You’re everything I want you to be
(But not when we were scared)
You’re a no good baby
You’re no good, you’re no good

[Trackname: Carbon]
Slanderer
A taste that doesn’t leave your tongue alone
Carpenter
Illuminate the labyrinth beneath my home
Oh, Deirdre, that’s the trouble with you
You are drawn to the bottom
I’m a simple man from where the Alanthis grow
And I’ll carry my choice til the Horse advances on my window
So peddler, won’t you take it down the block?
