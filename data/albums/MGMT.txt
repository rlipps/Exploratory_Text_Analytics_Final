[Trackname: Alien Days]

Sometimes the windows combine with the seams in a way
That twitches on a peak at the place where the spirit was slain
Hey, one foot leads to another, night's for sleep, blue curtains, covers
Sequins in the eyes, that's a fine time to dine
Divine who's circling, feeding the cards to the midwives
Who love those alien days
The nonstop alien days
Ooh, the alien days

Must've skipped the ship and joined the team for a ride
A couple hours to learn the controls and commandeer both my eyes
Hey! Be quick dear, times are uncertain, one month crawling, next year blurring
Decades in the drain, monograms on the brain
Decide what's working and what's moved on to the last phase
The floodgate alien days
I love those alien days
Mmm, the alien days

When the peels are down it feels like traveling in style
You don't need wings to hover forty-ton stones for a mile
And in the summer, virgin visions, mindless humming
Numbers can't decide if the day's supposed to smile
Today, find infinite ways it could be plenty worse
It's a blessing but it's also a curse

Those days taught me everything I know
How to catch a feeling and when to let it go
How all the scheming, soulless creatures
Can't find dreamer's honey in the hive
If it's right beneath the nose
And when the light is new, the sky shows trembling cartoons
You don't need smoke to cover most of the world in a gloom
But here comes racer number 7
Watch my fingers ripping out the lines
If it looks like we could lose

If it looks like we could lose
If it looks like we could lose
If it looks like we could 

[Trackname: Cool Song No. 2]

Whenever I drift by the unknown
Feign like I notice a fundamental tone
The fine petals open and close offended
Poor explanation and nothing shown

Kind of like if a friend exits without a sign
Glimmering like a precious stone
Maybe we shared a dream fornights in a row
I might feel better knowing that I was alone

Wherever scientists turn lead to birds
Torment ignites essence, delights from the earth
What you find shocking, they find amusing
Something else to soften a sadistic urge

When they tell you the extent of the vice
Then the prime time mission is to choke the statistician
And like the senses that you're lurking behind
While it gnaws right through to your core
Oh I'd twist it more

If you think that you're free (Free like a kite)
Watching as it flies by (Spy the unknown)
Focus on the quiet oars
Tell me how far you'd go (Go where you like)
Knowing your air won't last (Last one to know)
Would you feel better holding the stars up
What if the beast escapes (apes have it good)
And separates like a cloud (loud like a fault)
Seeps into the hollow bones
Wouldn't its eyes expand and zero in like a scope
I might feel better knowing I wasn't 

[Trackname: Mystery Disease]

It can't pay attention
What slips into the system
A light touch, a whisper that puts you to sleep
Don't sympathize with the mystery disease
All it is is a feeling
Pain in a dress too revealing
A lost bond
An old friend who likes what it sees
You can't shake off the mystery disease

Lovers in a past life
Meet in the street close to midnight
A last look
Sweet like the end of a dream
Then fall back into the mystery disease
Go on, tell your symptoms to me
It's not in any of the books you can read
It's no fun to face what you don't get to be
But what's one more to the mystery disease?

Floating impatience
Snuffs my limited sapience
Black smoke as soon as the pressure's released
Deep space sighs, the Mystery Disease
Consumed by a weakness
Cut with perpetual unrest
You see stars, sunsets blurred through a screen
Trap what you want
Waste what you need
And when the west wind sweeps through the leaves
Emperors of history fall to their knees
Small fronds can't see the wood for the trees
Left in the dust of the mystery 

[Trackname: Introspection]

Glowing in the shadows
Twisted in confusion
Grazing in the meadows
Voices in profusion
Colors, thoughts, emotions
Are trapped within the heart
Feeling no emotions
End without a start

Introspection, what am I really like inside?
Introspection, why have all the prophets lied?
There's a season when I will find out where I am
And there's a reason, and I will someday find the plan

Striving for perfection
And hiding when it comes
Seeing its reflection
And the fire it becomes
Turning of the seasons
And turning outside in
Burning with the reasons
Burning for revenge
Introspection, what am I really like inside?
Introspection, why have all the prophets lied?
There's a season when I will find out where I am
And there's a reason, and I will someday find the plan

Tripled by the onslaught
Speeding feud of time
Dying by the unloved
Of voices in the pride

Introspection, what am I really like inside?
Introspection, why have all the prophets lied?
There's a season when I will find out where I am
And there's a reason, and I will someday find the plan
Introspection, what am I really like inside?
Introspection, why have all the prophets lied?
There's a season when I will find out where I am
And there's a reason, and I will someday find the plan
Introspection, what am I really like inside?
Introspection, why have all the prophets lied?
There's a season when I will find out where I am
And there's a reason, and I will someday find the 

[Trackname: Your Life Is a Lie]

Here’s the deal
Open your eyes
Your life is a lie
Don’t say a word
I’ll tell you why
You’re living a lie
Your life is a lie
But you deny
You ever lied
Wondering why
Bury your life
Count your friends
On your hands
Now look again
They’re not your friends
Hold your breath
Everyone left
No surprise
Living a lie

Tell your wife
This is your life
Your life is a lie
This is your wife
Now she knows
She understands
Her life is a lie
Nobody wins
Try not to cry
You’ll survive
On your own (On your own)
Lessons in life
Your life is a lie
Now there’s no time
Wondering why
Where in the world
Is that girl?
He knows it’s alright
To live a life
Waiting to die
Not knowing that
Your life is a lie
Wondering why
Nobody writes
Hollow inside
Periods in light
Fire and ice
Your life is a lie
Your life is a lie
Your life is a lie
Your life is a lie
On your own
One more time
Your life is a 

[Trackname: A Good Sadness]

I can still hear the reflections in the air
Feeding time
Either hemisphere, if it's summer there
Seeking you, taking a dive
Streets realigned
Ooh ooh ooh
Stored in my mind

All I could do not to steal
All the fun in the world
From your little heart
And now I owe it back to you
But it's hard to catch it and let it go
Find excuses to burn right through the grief
And to melt, to melt, to melt

Oh my poor memories
Down to a trace
'Til you forget that, I'm alive
And you feel it's all right
Ooh I'm sure you'll be fine
Tune it out
And I'm sure you'll be fine
Doing well
Finding an excuse
Shutting down soon (over my eyes)
Lost the recall

No line
Disprove
Mean time
Desperate
Confide
Inrush
Disprove
Mean time
Inrush
No line
Desperate
Confide
Inrush
Disprove
No line
Inrush
No line
Over my eyes...
Over my eyes...
Over my eyes...
Over my eyes..

[Trackname: Astro-Mancy]


My green silken river and two lights
I could almost touch the free walls
When we were evicted from the heavens
Fast clouded-over bumbling eyes

Now peering out through a sinking
Cosmic smile, reversed completely
Flaming currents forced us to surface
Wet purple gowns and blaring alarms
All for some milky perversion
Nothing the spooks wouldn't be used to
Spoiled by an empty fear of violence
The only time I've ever been dropped

The minute the mirror turned its back to me
My distinct conviction of keeping
Eternal sources piled somewhere familiar
Was compromised and tangled in knots

For all I know we were sleeping
Arranged like Fate's vain infantry
Stacked in unconscious opposition
Blind and happy for tomorrow
For tomorrow...
For tomorrow..

[Trackname: I Love You Too, Death]

Who is much more than a friend
But never by my side?
All beginnings are an end
In the blackness there’s a light
Maybe you will only read
One or two letters at the most
Shipping crates might line the streets
Every stranger is a ghost

Cashiers won’t deduct the pain
Loneliness sleeps on the couch
Only noticing the stain
Once the color’s faded out
Let’s go camping in the cold
Make a fire, buy a tent
Envision leather getting old
Re-send pigeons that were sent

Try to memorize your smell
It reminds me of a field
Crickets clearer than a bell
Have all their guts recast in steel
Birds don’t cry when echoes quit
They trail off into the fog
Autumn hurts far less than sticks
Knowing winter’s five feet tall
Generations of defeat
All assuming you're the worst
They never tied the cans
To the back end of a hearse
Take your hand against my own
If there’s a finger I can grip
Reassure me at the ace
Mine’s a black heart you could flip

I’ve come to terms with what I have
What’s been given, what’s been asked
Turn my back against the sea
And beg the serpent for a dance
But in the red dirt muddy towns
Celebration of the dark
Children walking hand in hand
With the pygmies in zee park

I can’t touch you only once
You always leave me wanting more
So keep my feet within the house
And stick my toes just past the door
Let me know when I’m in love
Let me die when I’m in 

[Trackname: Plenty Of Girls In The Sea]

There's plenty of girls in the sea
And plenty of seeds in a lemon
The trick is to try to stay free
When it's never that great to begin with
The surgeon performs precise little cuts
But he's never perfect, he's thinking too much
Oh, and it's really no comfort to me
There's plenty of girls in the sea

There's plenty of girls in the sea
And plenty of those are not women
As soon as you get yourself free
Then somebody stops you from swimming
The lifeguard admits, his whistle in hand
That it isn't the muscle, and it isn't the tan
No it's whatever you want it to be
There's plenty of girls in the sea

Ah the passionate painter will say with a brush:
"It's best to accept it and not make a fuss
Oh, Just cause the grass isn't green"
Yeah, there's plenty of girls in the sea
There's plenty of girls in the sea
And plenty of clowns in the village
The trick is to try to be free
And tend to the void, don't just fill it
The bartender concedes, from inside his vest
That none of the best ones were ever the best
So keep it short, simple and sweet
Cause there's plenty of girls in the sea

(Plenty of girls) in the sea
Yeah, there's plenty of girls in the sea
(Plenty of girls) in the sea
Oh, there's plenty of girls in the sea
(Plenty of girls) in the sea
Yeah, there's plenty of girls in the sea
(Plenty of girls)
Whenever you want there to 

[Trackname: An Orphan Of Fortune]

It can't stop now
The signs keep changing on me
Like a shimmering bell
Long waves enveloping me
And my plastic mind
So chewed and shrinking all the time
Feels it whirling by
Morning, afternoon then night
And I can't get down
*Break*

If I don't feel right
Polishing off the sand
Lay by me
And we'll erode
As gently as we can
Into the twilight
Into the twilight
Into the twilight
Into the twilight
