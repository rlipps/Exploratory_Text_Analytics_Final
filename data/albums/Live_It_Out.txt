[Trackname: Empty]

There was no way out
The only way out was to give in
When there's no way out, the only way out is to give in
How I love to...
How I love to...
How I love to give in

Here, no one sleeps
One lays up while the other lies down
Where no one sleeps, one lays up while the other lies down
Ask the line on your face what the line on your hand meant
We, we couldn't see what was coming

Shake your head, it's empty
Shake your hips, move your feet
Shake your head, it's empty
Shake your hips, move your feet
Shake your head, it's empty
Shake your head, it's empty
Shake your head, it's empty
Shake your head, it's empty
I'm so glad that I'm an island
I'm so glad that I'm an island
I'm so glad that I'm an island now

Sickness was fixing me some
Coughed out my heart in the last stall
Now that the damage is done
I never miss it at 

[Trackname: Glass Ceiling]

Only know what I'm told, only know what I'm told
Fast asleep, daydreaming
Start to push, break your own glass ceiling
Can't count, catch the pieces falling

Who?
Who?
Who let it end up on the ground?
Who?
Who?
How am I gonna know you're letting me down?
How'd I end up on the ground?

Only do what I'm told, only do what I'm told
Last to leave, cold calling
You're gonna lose your arms
Amputate, Plasticine
There's no knight in silver armor, shining

Who?
Who?
Who let it end up on the ground?
Who?
Who?
How am I gonna know I'm letting you down?
Who?
Who?
Who let it end up on the ground?
How did he end up on the ground?
Face down on the ground
Only go where I'm told, only know what I'm told
Inch to inches, crowding
We can't leave, it's the last road open
Every speed on our knees is crawling

Every speed on our knees is crawling
Every speed on our knees is crawling
Every speed on our knees is crawling

[Trackname: Handshakes]

Say you wanna get in
And then you wanna get out
When you get the money
To buy yourself a castle
How will you wear your leisure?
Your zipper back and front
On the fence together
Weekends in leather
Flip to the right
Slip back to the left
For handshakes at the ranch
Small talk at the crossroads
Rubbing up to the ladder
Sucking on every rung
Coming up forever and hanging on

That's entertainment
When the cameras roll
Can you face the pavement
For a happy dog and pony show?
Everybody loves you, baby
Of course they do
Do you miss me?
I miss you
Buy this car to drive to work
Drive to work to pay for this car
Buy this car to drive to work
Drive to work
Buy this car to drive to work
Drive to work to pay for this car
Buy this car to drive to work
Drive to work to pay for this car

Say you wanna get in
And you're gonna get out
But you won't
'Cause it's a trap

[Trackname: Too Little Too Late]

You can burn your paper fingers in the ashtray
Place your swollen lips on mine
You can shave your heavy head in my carpeted hallway
Sure for the first time you're wearing the right clothes

Now take them off
Meet me on the band room rug
Tie my right hand to the ride

You can take a live wire into the bath with you
For a feeling you can't find
You can entertain your childhood friends with a tour of the bedroom
Laugh to erase the dirt on your mind

Oh, let's move out
Meet me at the motel
Tie my right hand to the bible
Too little, too late but we don't say no
It's too much to feel
Tie my right hand to the bible

[Trackname: Poster Of A Girl]

Can't stand by myself
Hate to sleep alone
Surprises always help
So I take somebody home
To find out how I feel
I feel like just a baby

Je sais que tu n'aimes pas ta réalité
Tu sais que tu n'aimes pas ta réalité
Tu sais que je n'aime pas ma réalité
Je sais que tu n'aimes pas ta réalité
Tu sais que je n'aime pas ma réalité
On ne peut pas fabriquer la vérité
Tu sais que tu n'aimes pas ta réalité
Je sais que tu n'aimes pas ta réalité

Satisfy myself
Avoid beginners
Who long to shut my mouth
Till I take one of them home
'Cause I know how it feels
Filling in the blanks
Looking on the bright side
When there is no bright side
Coming in your pants
For the off chance with a...

Je déteste dormir sans une présence
Les surprises semblent alléger ma solitude
Alors je ramène quelqu'un dans mon lit
Afin de découvrir comment je me sens

Eviter les novices
Ceux qui cherchent à me faire taire
Jusqu'à ce que je rentre avec l'un d'eux
Car je connais la sensation
De chercher le fil d'or
Et de ne jamais le trouver
Coming in your pants
Qui ne pense qu'à coucher avec une

You hold my hands down, I've been bad

Daddy Warbucks up against Bobby Fuller
And he beat him, hands down
Lead in his head
They put a little lead in, in his head

[Trackname: Patriarch On a Vespa]
Promiscuous makes an entrance
Her mouth is full of questions
Are we all brides to be?
Are we all designed to be confined?
Buy ourselves chastity belts and lock them
Organize our lives and lose the key
Our faces all resemble dying roses
From trying to fix it
Trying to fix it
Trying to fix it
When instead, we should break it
We've got to break it before it breaks us
Fear of pretty houses and their porches
Fear of biological wrist watches
Fear of comparison shopping
Dogs on leashes behind fences, barking
Pretty little pillows on floral couches
Until our faces all resemble dying roses
Stop trying to fix it
Patriarch on a Vespa
Runs a red and ends up
Crushed under the wheel

[Trackname: The Police and the Private]

Get straight, wait here while I try to find the exit sign
When will you stop asking strangers?
No one wants what we want
Keep one eye on the door, keep one eye on the bag
Never expect to be sure

You're working for the police and the private
The pirates and the pilots
Fingerprinted, waiting for the train
The doctor, the writer, the hairdresser
Felt up and fingerprinted, waiting for the train
Lord, lord, mother, we are all losing love
Lord, listen lover, we are all missing mama
Lord, lord, mother, we are all losing love
Lord, listen lover, we are all missing something (I don't got)

There's a place that ends here
I know when they close the gates, I'll cry
I'm so tired of never sleeping
The whole world wants what we're on
Didn't make this up, I learned
I learned it from a friend
My friend is coming clean, she told me
"Keep one eye on the door, keep one eye on the bed
Never expect to be sure who you're working for."
You're working for the police and the private

Got to get out
Got to get to you, the orphanage is closing in an hour

[Trackname: Ending Start]
All this that is more than a wish is a memory
All this that is ceases to be
All is revealed
The obvious door opens nothing
Nothing, nothing left, nothing left
Nothing left to chance
When you try to see, we'll watch you
When you try to leave, we'll keep you
When you should be dreaming, we'll wake you
But don't scream, we'll make you swallow your words
Gave them our reactions, our explosions, all that was ours
For graphs of passion and charts of stars
Gave them our reactions, our explosions, all that we are
For graphs of passion and charts of stars

[Trackname: Live It Out]

Hope I live it out
Hope I live it out
Hope I...

On the day we were supposed to leave
You changed your mind at the station
You had a nice apartment
There was a good bar downstairs
Your old friend worked there
I'll go anyway, I'll go anyway
They won't refund the ticket
Well, it's a good story

But I don't wanna live it alone
Crash to take a chance
I wanna live it out
I know I'm already dead
No concrete adversity
Only traps of our own actions
How we wanted it to be
Now, I'm never gonna see you again
You turned off
Vertebrae by vertebrae
Roll your way out of a coma
Look up, the nurse is smiling
What luck, the nurse is me
Your old body is dead
Your body's dead, you're a word instead
In my sleep, I repeat it
Well, it's a good story

But I don't wanna live it alone
Crash to take a chance
We were gonna live it out
Look at you, you're already dead
How will you remember me?
Digging ditches out of boredom
Said you could never leave
Now, you're never gonna be here again
You checked out
