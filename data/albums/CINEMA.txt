I'ma live in the past, look at the videos
I'ma give you the wheel
What do you want to know?
And I'm calling you back
Don't wanna be alone
'Cause you do me like that
Why would you do me like that?
Mama told me keep it real

Spin it and live in it
But I'm calling you back
Don't want to be alone
'Cause you do me like that
Why would you do me like that?

When I wake up
Tell me it's a song and not a breakup
I'll see you in the morning when we make up
You want me out of your life too soon
So can you lay here?
Make a drink and have a holiday here
Diamonds on the bed to hold your place here
I won't be out of your life too soon
I'ma live in the past, look at the videos

Why would you do me like that?

I've been on my level, don't mess around
Maybe I'm the devil that brought you down
Meet me on the other side, yeah
I'll meet you on the other side, yeah
I guess I messed up, babe, I deserve this, yeah
I'm calling you back, pick up, out of service
I'ma live in the past, look at the videos

[Trackname: Hush]

Don't act so special
What I do is not for you
Forget about it
You made this mess
I'll knock at your door
Don't you ignore
Or forget about it

(Every night) Got you running in circles, I know
(Touchin' me) Get your paws off my Dolce cologne
(Back it up) Off my throne 'cause you know you wanna
(Make me) Walk away and forget about it
Hush
Hush

Don't think you've made it under my skin
Could never get in
Forget about it
Don't talk so much
Your tongue is burning up
I've had enough
Forget about it
(Every night) Got you running in circles, I know
(Touchin' me) Get your paws off my Dolce cologne
(Back it up) Off my throne 'cause you know you wanna
(Make me) Walk away and forget about it

Falling in my den
Full of lions, full of breath
Take the muzzle from their heads
I'm a sucker for revenge
I see you falling in my den
Full of lions, full of breath
I take the muzzle from their heads
I'm a sucker for revenge
Don't act so special
Don't act so good
Forget about it

(Every night) Got you running in circles, I know
(Touchin' me) Get your paws off my Dolce cologne
(Back it up) Off my throne 'cause you know you wanna
(Make me) Walk away and forget about it
Hush

[Trackname: All I Really Want Is You]

Breakdown, I'm overworking 'till the sundown
Don't see the light inside my head now
I need to see you in my window
In a whisper

All I really want is you
What would you do?
Laying in the rain with you
Middle of June
All I really want is you
What would you do?
Sleeping outside, the moon
Tripping with you

Head down
I don't know when to come up for air now
You take my hand like there's a way out (Right now)
And we're escaping through the window
And I whisper

All I really want is you
What would you do?
Laying in the rain with you
Middle of June
All I really want is you
What would you do?
Sleeping outside, the moon
Tripping with you
All I really want is you

All I really want is you
What would you do?
Laying in the rain with you
Middle of June
All I really want is you
What would you do?
Sleeping outside, the moon
Tripping with you

All I really want is you
What would you do?
Laying in the rain with you
Middle of June
All I really want is you
What would you do?
Sleeping outside, the moon
Tripping with you
All I really want is you
Is you, is you, is

Quiero amanecer entre tu piel de miel
Luego acariciarte hasta quitar tu sed
Tal y como estás me enredo en tu ser
Dame un ratito para aparecer

I wanna make you feel alright
I wanna do it right this time
No matter what the hell I say
It don't mean that I don’t wanna stay
Promise I'll apologize, baby
'Cause honestly, I’m changing
You got the moonlight stuck in your teeth
You got me tongue-tied tryna gеt it

Little by little
Little by littlе
Little by little
Little by little
Vamos a quedarnos en tu cielo, amor
Juntos, enredados en tu habitación
Pase lo que pase, moriré en paz
Dame un ratito para hacerte más

I wanna make you feel alright
I wanna do it right this time
No matter what the hell I say
It don't mean that I don't wanna stay
Promise I'll apologize, baby

You got me tongue-tied tryna get it

[Trackname: Heavy]

I'm heavy, I'm by your side
Forget me 'cause I know what I need
Like a loser like me could be fine
I'm heavy, alone inside
Don't tell me what I want, what I need
Like a loser like me will be fine

Maybe I'm living in my head
Maybe I'm living to pretend
Maybe I wanna stay in bed
Far from the weight of the world
In my hands, 'cause they don't understand

Is someone telling me "Don't get in the water"?
What havе I done?
I don't wanna get lost inside thе color under my tongue
'Cause I don't want to be in love with another
Even in another life
Can someone tell me it's alright to be covered
Underneath the covers?
But I, no, I don't need to sleep anymore

Is someone banging at my door
When I just wanna be alone?
Is someone banging at my door?
Je ne sais pas qui est ici
Is someone banging at my door
When I just wanna be alone?
Is someone banging at my door, door, door, door?
Door, door, door, door, my door
Is someone banging at my door?
'Cause I just wanna be alone
Yeah, I just wanna be alone
I just wanna be alone
Yeah, I just wanna be alone
I just wanna be 

[Trackname: Un Millón]


Quiero amanecer junto a ti
En tus sábanas de miel
Con mis manos en tu piel
Quiero amanecer junto a ti
Nunca más verte sufrir
Vamos juntos hasta el fin

Quiero besarte entero, amor
Vamos juntitos hacia Bayamón
Luego a Luquillo pa' tomar el sol
Estar contigo es puro dembow

Bailando junto a ti
Yo quemándome en tu cuello
Tú te mueves hacia mí
Fuego aquí que está bailándote, bebé
Me llevas
Bailándote, bebé
Me quemas

Me dices, ciеlo
Cada momento
Me arde por dеntro
No me compares
Y cada movimiento
Se pone bueno
El party nuestro
No me compares (Ayy)
Quiero besarte entero, amor
Vamos juntitos hacia Bayamón
Luego a Luquillo pa' tomar el sol
Estar contigo es puro dembow

Bailando junto a tí
Yo quemándome en tu cuello
Tú te mueves hacia mí
Fuego aquí que está bailándote, bebé
Me llevas
Bailándote, bebé
Me quemas

[Trackname: Spin Me Around]

Daisy, you got me slippin', actin' lazy
Maybe I'm trippin' but I don't mind
Makin' a picnic on the hillside
I'll save some room for you

'Cause I know what you're thinking about
Babe, I'll let you spin me around
I know what you're thinking about
Babe, I'll let you spin me

Daisy, cherry tattoo be looking tasty
I like the necklace that you made me
My heart is breaking for you baby
But I'll save some room for you

'Cause I know what you're thinkin' about
Babe, I'll let you spin me around
I know what you're thinking about
Babe, I'll let you spin me around
Babe, I'll let you spin me around

[Trackname: The Mice Inside This Room]

Every word came out too soon
There are mice inside my room
So tender, they run
Burned it all again
So tender they run
Burned it all again

If we stay can we get it right
Pushing my love aside
Before I sleep tonight
Sing me a lullaby
Losing my appetite
Pushing my love aside
Same scene I was kept alive
Same scene you were kept-

Nervous and I'm listening
Making fun of everything
Thеy are taking pictures of my face
So tеnder, they run

If I stay can we get it right?
Pushing my love aside
Before I sleep tonight
Sing me a lullaby
Losing my appetite
Pushing my love aside
Same scene I was kept alive
Same scene you were kept alive
If I stay can we get it right (Talk it over when you're through)
Pushing my love aside
Before I sleep tonight
Sing me a lullaby
Losing my appetite (Cause I have heard the running too)
Pushing my love aside
Same scene I was kept alive
Same scene you were kept-

I let you go, I let you go
I let you go, I let you go
I let you go, I let you go
I let you go, I let you go
I let you go, I let you go
I let you go, I let you go
I let you go, I let you go
I let you go, I let you go
I let you go, I let you go
I let you go, I let you go
I let you go, I let you go
I let you go, I let you go
I let you go, I let you go
I let you go, I let you go
I let you go, I let you 

[Trackname: To Say Hello]

You called me up, you said I know
I miss you, I messed up
I say goodnight, now I'm falling to the floor
I miss you, I messed up

I called to say hello
Take the summertime to grow
I'll see you when it's cold
When darkness starts to fold
'Cause baby I'm afraid to feel
Lost my mind there at the wheel
Don't know which way to go
I know why, I know why

'Cause I belong in here, I said it
I'll never forget it
'Cause I belong in here
Wait a minute, let me finish
I'll admit it

You wanna talk, I'm hanging up
I miss you, I messed up

Take the summertime to grow
I'vе seen this all before
I know why, I know why

I'll never forget it

Wait a minute, let me finish
I'll admit it

[Trackname: Fog as a Bullet]


Estaré contando el tiempo en mí
Contando hasta morir
Qué falta me haces aquí

Estaré volando entre niebla y el mar
Volando entre dioses y paz
Qué rabia que ya tú no estás (Mm)


Llorando
Me la paso llorando
Me la paso añorando
Me la paso en ti
Llorando
Me la paso llorando
Me la paso añorando
Me la paso en ti

[Trackname: Talk to Her]

It all comes and goes in waves
Everything looks the same
The cornfields, the cows, the flies, the coughing
The musky air that fills our rows and permeates
Even through the ash infested vents from the fires
Eating away at the barks of trees like this moment
Eating away at the last dose of happiness lingering on the dust of our bones
The other night, wrapped in crispy motel sheets
I clenched my body and pretended I was an embryo in my mother's womb
It was the only source of warmth and comfort that could sing me to sleep
But now, I see the sheep out the window on green pastures
I hope they have water
I sometimes imagine myself being reincarnated as one
And jumping over these low wire fences to freedom
I wonder how far I could make it without a human catching me
Taming me, bringing me back to their living painting
A life to look at as they wash the dishes, smeared with my mother's milk that they stole from me
It's raining, finally
And the van is slowly drifting into the other lane
Eddie is driving
Everyone else is asleep, sometimes coming up for air
Their heads poking up like groundhogs before sinking back into their holes
But it's not all dark and grim
There are moments of hope
They come to me when it's quiet
They come to me when everyone is synched in their levels of happy, which doesn't happen often, but when it does, it's nice
I wonder if we'll look back and think that these miles of cornfields, these anguished breaths, these forced smiles, these moments that were gone, the momentary calms
And the thousands of little bugs pressed against our windshield
Were all worth it
I don't know exactly where I'm supposed to be
There's a hollow thought that takes control of me
Don't stop giving up, don't stop giving up
Don't stop giving up, don't stop giving up
Don't stop giving up, don't stop giving up
Don't stop giving up, don't stop giving up
Don't stop giving up, don't stop giving up
Don't stop giving up, don't stop giving up
Don't stop giving up, don't stop giving up
Don't stop giving up, don't stop giving up
Don't stop giving up, don't stop giving up
Don't stop giving up, don't stop giving up
Don't stop giving up, don't stop giving
