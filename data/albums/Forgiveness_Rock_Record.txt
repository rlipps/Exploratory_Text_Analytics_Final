[Trackname: World Sick]


We got a minefield of crippled affection
All for the borrowed mirror connection
That's why I'm leaving this spoken detention
I'm a romance addict so that I can confess that:

I get world sick every time I take a stand
Well, I get world sick, my love is for my man

We got a lady who's wanting to dance
Men with the maybe looking for endings

And I get world sick every time I take a stand
Yeah, I get world sick, my love is for my man


I'm sick of the self-love, losing the "bless me"
The exit the roof of the rule of what we'll be
And all the destroyers that never wore dresses
They live for the older, well, I'll confess this:
I get world sick every time I take a stand
Well, I get world sick, my love is for my man
I get world sick every time I take a stand
Well, I get world sick, my love is for my man


[Trackname: Chase Scene]
All the dirty fingers picking up finds
Bruised with a motherless childish mind
To be kind in the line of design
Without a proper subject
Got all apologies, signed up to steal
Prednisone body, topic of ill
For the chill and the thrill of the kill
I see my woman calling
Because I licked a little skin like a fear in my bed
Spilt all the toxic cream of my dead
To be bled or fed in the spread
Of equal wrong talking
Spoon me like a stereotype, rigging the race
Believing in a feather, particular face
With the grace for the trace to embrace
The frontal feel falling
I think I'm ready to go
I think I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
I think I'm ready to go
I think I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
Yeah, I'm ready to go
Yeah, I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
Yeah, I'm ready to go
Yeah, I'm ready to fight
If the caterpillar cat turns free to a whore
The idea that there's a seventeenth floor
To explore like hardcore for the more
And never seem to free it
Because I gave a little long, yeah, I gave it a shot
Bought me some land and a beautiful plot
With a hot who was not to be got
By easy thinking thumbing
Bottled up can will eat through your life
Down with the deed of killing a wife
With a knife who thinks twice to the wise
I think my woman's calling
Yeah, I'm ready to go
Yeah, I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
Yeah, I'm ready to go
Yeah, I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
Yeah, I'm ready to go
Yeah, I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
I think I'm ready to go
I think I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
I think I'm ready to go
I think I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
I think I'm ready to go
I think I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
Yeah, I'm ready to go
Yeah, I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
Yeah, I'm ready to go
Yeah, I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life

[Trackname: Texico Bitches]

Texico bitches, have you begun again?
Texico bitches, I think you found a friend
Texico bitches, the air you breathe is real
Texico bitches, why do you like to steal?

I wanna be fair
Like a wannabe fag

Texico bitches, this town is going down (Sparkle like an old drone)
Texico bitches, I hope you stick around (Melt like a snowcone)
Texico bitches, the guns beneath the youth (Talking on the phone-phone)
Texico bitches, this story needs some truth (Every time I'm going, I'm only gonna miss you)

I wanna be fair
Like a wannabe fag
I wanna be fair
Like a wannabe fag


Texico bitches, the light is coming in
Texico bitches, I think we're bound to win
Texico bitches, my weapon is my truce (Tire of a hobo)
Texico bitches, I do not like to lose (Talking on the phone-phone)
I wanna be fair
Like a wannabe flag
I wanna be fair
Like a wannabe fag

[Trackname: Forced To Love]

Well, if you think about it then you're a fool, yeah
It's just a size and the mind that won't give you up
And if I think about it, well, am I cool yet?
Because it's the word of the mouth that won't cut you up
And if we think about it, well, is it true yet?
Because there's no line that reminds whether we are enough
So let's think about it, oh, are we through yet?
It's just the crime at the time of a masculine hug

Because we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
All the time
Forced to love

When we speak about it (Made the right always open)
And if I speak about it (Erase the lies, love is frozen)
So if you think about it, what would you do?
You're just the man with the plan saying we are not lost
So let's think about it, oh, are we through yet?
It's just the time to decide if we can move up, up, up, up

Because we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
All the time
Forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love

Because we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
All the time
Forced to love

Well, if you think about it then you're a fool, yeah
Because you decide to believe in what we made up
And if I think about it, am I cool yet?
Because there's no lie like that lie that made us give up

[Trackname: All To All]

Call of forgiveness
I'm like the beat of the hurt
I'm not the only one you tried to save when you fell out
Call of forgiveness
I'm like the clean in the dirt
I'm not the only one you tried to crave when you fell out

(Try, wait) You made your life on everything
(Hard, made) You made your life on everything
(Try, wait) You made your life on everything
(Long, fade) You made your life on everything

Call of forgiveness
I'm like the heal of the hurt
I'm like the only one you tried to save when you fell out
Call of forgiveness
I'm like the queen of the dirt
I'm like the only one who tried to stay when you fell out

It's like the common law was wall to wall and almost faded
I've seen the gone to small, the lost of law, the almost made it
It seems like mine to shine, you'll always find the lonely ray
It's like the wall to fall, the fall of all, the laws are graded
I've seen the lies that call, the pictures tall, the lines are made in
It's like the fight to crawl, my darling, all you've lived your age
I know it's all to all, all to all ultimatum
It's like the all to all, all to all ultimatum
It's like the all to all, the all to all, the ultimatum
I know it's all to all, all to all ultimatum
Just like the all to all, all to all ultimatum
It's like the all to all, the all to all, the ultimatum
You made your life on everything
You made your life on everything

[Trackname: Art House Director]

Art house director, art house director
We lost magic light until tomorrow night
Art house director, art house director
Make the waters part into an empty heart

It's been like a joke
Every step of the way
Is there something to coax
The truth of the day?

Defeat deflector, defeat deflector
The rushes will not lie, I swear this is your guy
And the starlet is a harlot, she does not leave the trailer
She thinks that you're a jailer or someone that delayed her

It's been like a joke
Every step of the way
Is there something to coax
The truth of the day?
It's been like a joke
Every step of the way
Is there something to coax
The truth of the day?
I never meant for it to be that way
But since I have your attention
I'll just give you what you want
And maybe I'll be in your trailer

Canyon connector, purist protector
All the fun fell through, we can't escape the gloom
And the starlet is a harlot, she will not leave the trailer
She says that you betrayed her with a surfer from Australia

It's been like a joke
Every step of the way
Is there something to coax
The truth of the day?
It's been like a joke
Every step of the way
Is there something to coax
The truth of the day?

[Trackname: Highway Slipper Jam]

There was a way with the promises
And in a little while another way
Has it moved highways

Thought I knew
But I don't

Out here we're made all of us, always
Hand made mistakes
Move on through my wake
I look away, I look away
Looks like you wanna be
Highways, highways


[Trackname: Ungrateful Little Father]

Ungrateful little motherfuck, boredom tuck
Beat you up with bedrooms of ice
I see you've got another one almost done
Bet you think that you wished twice
I see you standing over there, underwear
The milk is going to bring you a fight
Ungrateful little motherfuck, built you up
A brand new breakthrough device

Heard about your almost-kin touching skin
And leaving pictures out of the book
I thought that all the should've beens might've hid
Beneath all that they took
Never said I was the man who held the tan
And breathed while we violently shook
Ungrateful little motherfuck, boredom tuck
Up all that we could

But buildings have another tease, try to please
Leaving all the press pulled apart
Oh, I feel you like an evil wind, sucka twin
Dying for the "never" of stop
What, you going to seal this with all that's missed?
Oh, I think you're pulling my heart
Ungrateful little motherfuck, horror tucked
Up what you never have thought
If I see you with a cracked up kid who never wins
Dying for the little you've got
If I see you with a cracked up kid, double kick
Down to the floor of the rot

[Trackname: Sentimental X's]

A friend, a friend you used to call
A friend, a friend you used to call
When you back me, I was gone
When you back me, I was gone

Off and on is what we want
What we want is off and on
Off and on is what we want
What we want is off and on

Friend of a friend you used to call
Friend of a friend you used
Friend of a friend you used
You used to call

I couldn't believe that's where they found us
When you and me, when the wild us
Taken alone, it isn't harmless
Shouldn't we keep it as a promise?

All for one and one for all
Friend, a friend you used to call
All for one and one for all
Everyone you knew
Everyone you knew
Sentimental, all of you
Sentimental, all of you
Sentimental
Sentimental, all of you
Sentimental, all of you
Sentimental
(All of you, all of you
All of you, all of you
All of you, all of you)
Sentimental
(All of you, all of you
All of you, all of you
All of you, all of you)

[Trackname: Sweetest Kill]

I thought you were the sweetest kill
Did I even know?
And all the time we thought we did
Was it just for show?
If they try to pull you out
Would you even go?
I thought you were the sweetest kill
Did you even know?

I held your hand until the light
The scars were on the back
And all the time we were the right
Was it just retract?
And they can try to put you down, wear you out
Get you through the idea of the luck
I thought you were the sweetest kill
Did we even know?

All the time, we get by
Trying to figure out our lives
Like a fade out
All the time, we get by
Trying to figure out our lives
Like a fade out
When we took the level ten
Was it just a twelve?
And when we went to where we've been
Was it just for self?
And they can try to wear you down, put you out
Get you through your will that won't work
I thought you were the sweetest kill
Could I even know?

All the time, we get by
Trying to figure out our lives
Like a fade out
All the time, we get by
Trying to figure out our lives
Like a fade out
All the time, we get by
Trying to figure out our lives
Like a fade out
All the time, we get by
Trying to figure out our lives
Like a fade out

I break you through this world
I break you through this world
Let me break you through this world
Can I break you through this world

[Trackname: Romance To The Grave]


When I'm right, I'm always wrong beneath the wise, rolling through the way
(Further my luck tries to be the same)
When I'm wrong, I'm almost right to breathe the miles coming through the haze
(Still like I thought)
I don't speak the tongues of finds within a life, dying for a save
(Stomp on guitar line)
I got buried with my tribe from the start, romance to the grave
(Star)
And in your house you built to fail through all the eyes, wondering what to say
(Followed by, "Keep on")
This might be the last of light inside your lock only you can break
(For all these times, never mind)
Because when you're right, you're never wrong to reach the high, low for you to wait
(Fall on days)

I don't lived for all that died
I just want to feel it again

[Trackname: Water In Hell]

The newspaper ride is hanging like a thread
You're looking for your sailor boy
The music uncertainly, disconcertingly
You're looking for your sailor boy

From what I can tell
There's water in hell

The shuck and jive, the shuck and jive is over
The shuck and jive, the shuck and jive is over
The second time, the second time is over
It's too bad the monkey's on your shoulder

Well the truth be a lying stone cold messiah
It's time to let the cash roll in
This ain't the kind of man I want to defend
It's the year

From what I can tell
There's water in hell
The shuck and jive, the shuck and jive is over
The shuck and jive, the shuck and jive is over
The second time, the second time got older
It's too bad the monkey's not

No one likes to lose (No one likes to lose)
No one likes to lose

There's water in hell
There's water in hell
There's water in hell
There's water in hell
There's water in hell
There's water in hell
There's water in hell

[Trackname: Me And My Hand]
(Vagina)
)
Me and my hand
We've been together
Since I was born
Since I was in the world
Seen the light go out
Seen light come in
Me and my hand
My true best friend
And my love
My love
Oh, my hand
I've got to give it up
I always love you
