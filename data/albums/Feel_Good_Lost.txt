Passport radio almost mine
Coming to you live

You're mine
Yes, all mine

[Trackname: Stomach Song]

Some boys I know
They speak with broken mouths
I have to sit inside their stomachs
To find out what they're really about

But not like the days
When the sky is blue
And all that I had
Is a little of me in a little of you

Some girls I know
They speak with broken mouths
I have to sit within their stomach
To find out what they're really about

Because nowadays
All people want are pills
To help them learn to talk
To help them learn to feel
And they can't be their eyes
Several times I've seen them try
No, they can't be their lives
Some boys I know
They speak with broken mouths
I have to sit inside their stomachs
To find out what they're really about

"Are you gonna play along?"
"Yeah"
"Are you gonna play along?"
"Yeah"
