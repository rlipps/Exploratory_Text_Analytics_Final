[Trackname: Dark Saturday]

Somewhere in the South of France
Or the Caribbean sea
She said "I don't need to make a living
Fake diamonds got nothing on me"
I met her in the world below
She's a tourist of the world beneath
I said "everything I built from nothing"
She said "I'm so rich, everything's free"

So dark
It ain't so dark
So dark
It ain't so dark

Forever and never
A torch in search of a flame
To be good, get better
Well I've been feeling this way
Forever and never
A night in search of a day
As anxious as ever
It's such a dark, dark, dark Saturday
What's your name and where you from?
Well I'm worth your weight in gold
While we lie here in the sun
The whole wide world's about to explode
Now our bodies intertwine
And the truth is plain to see
I said "everything I built from nothing"
She said "don't you blame your problems on me"

So dark
It ain't so dark
So dark
It ain't so dark
So dark
It ain't so dark

Forever and never
A torch in search of a flame
To be good, get better
I change by staying the same
Forever and never
A night in search of a day
As anxious as ever
It gets so dark, dark, dark
Shine a light my way
Shine a light my way
Having such a dark, dark, dark, dark Saturday
Shine a light my way

It's such a
Dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark Saturday
Dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark Saturday
Dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark

I’m gonna dry all my tears today
Got no patience for old pain
Tell my friends to shake the sad parade
I’m gonna lift up and fly away
It’s been far too long
I'd wait in vain for better days, than pouring rain
I’m gonna stand up and drop these chains
I’ve been held in place with wire and lace
And waltzed around the drain

When you’ve got no time
You’re gonna want it back
You’re gonna act so bad
You’re gonna act so badly

I wanna love you back so bad
I wanna love you back so bad
I wanna love you back so bad
You’re everyone I never had
I wanna love you back so bad
I wanna love you back so bad
I wanna love you back so bad
You’re everyone I never had

I’m gonna cut out and waste the day
Dump some diamonds in the lake
Truly appreciate my luck can change
I’m gonna strip off your whitewash stain
It’s a thin disguise that barely hides
Your painted face that falls away
I’m gonna dry all my tears today
I’ve been held in place with wire and lace
And waltzed around the drain

When you’ve got no time
You’re gonna want it back
You’re gonna want it badly
When you feel this light
When you feel this happy
You’re gonna act so bad
You’re gonna act so badly
I wanna love you back so bad
I wanna love you back so bad
I wanna love you back so bad
You’re everyone I never had
I wanna love you back so bad
I wanna love you back so bad
I wanna love you back so bad
You’re everyone I never had
I wanna love you back so bad
I wanna love you back so bad
I wanna love you back so bad
You’re everyone I never had

[Trackname: Die Happy]

So what is this so-so-society?
Still drinking that Kool-Aid like it's free
Still popping that poison, po-po-po
Political you know how it goes

Is this dystopia?
Is this dystopia?
Is this dystopia?
Is this dystopia?

Fame is the bait
(And the switch is the look in your eye)
What will you ask?
(While we wait for the past to arrive)
Fame is the bait
(And the switch is your head in the sand)
Time that we waste
(While we wait for the future to land)

Die happy
In the summertime
So happy
I could die
This city is thick with common thieves
Still passing around the same disease
Who's running this town and why are we?
Still drinking that Kool-Aid like it's free

In this dystopia
In this dystopia
In this dystopia
In this dystopia

Fame is the bait
(And the switch is the look in your eye)
What will you ask?
(While we wait for the past to arrive)
Fame is the bait
(And the switch is your head in the sand)
Time that we waste
(While we wait for the future to land)

Fame is the bait
(And the switch is your desolate smile)
If I need it
(Though we shelter the thing for a while)
Fame is the bait
(And the switch is the touch of your hand)
Time that we waste
(While we wait for the future to land)
Die happy
In the summertime
So happy
I could die
Die happy
In the summertime
So happy
I could die

Duh duh duh duh duh
Die happy
Duh duh duh duh duh

Duh duh duh duh duh

[Trackname: Now or Never Now]

It hurts to turn the radio on
My stamina’s gone, my spirit is weak
Because every time I start to move on
Keep hearing that song, I’m brought to my knees
To permanently see in reverse
Take the remorse out of defeat
Because everything that’s under my skin
Where I end and begin still belongs to me

I’m fine to sit and stare at the door
Can’t run anymore, too weary to stand
Abandon the effect with the cause
My life is on pause, it’s out of my hands
To perfectly perform in reverse
There’s no way to rehearse, there’s nothing to plan
Because everything that’s under my skin
Where I end and begin, that’s who I am

Oh, only silence can restore
The sense of place I had before
Oh, only silence can repair
My sense of self I lost somewhere
Oh oh, oh, only silence can restore
The sense of place I had before
Oh, only silence can repair
My sense of self I lost somewhere

Because the last time I let myself feel this way
It was a long, long time ago
And now we get so scared, and we get so scared
To be nowhere left alone
Because the last time you let yourself feel this way
It was a long, long time ago
And now we get so scared, and we get so scared
To be nowhere left alone

Because it’s now or never now
It’s now or never now, now, now
Because it’s now or never now
It’s now or never now, now, now
Because it’s now or never now
It’s now or never now, now, now
Because it’s now or never now
It’s now or never now, now, now, now, now, now, 

[Trackname: Art of Doubt]

Where do failed imposters go?
Burn the book that says you took the
(High road, high road)
Autumn, the fog rolls low
Over rooftops far below the
(High road, high road)
Springtime, the vespers chime
Blossoms fill the trees that line the
(High road, high road)
Where did all your worries go?
Now I guess we'll never know
How you hit the
Well, how you hit the

You said "don't let your heart give out"
No, I won't let my heart give out
You said "don't let your breath run out"
No, I won't let my breath run out

Well it's true, I push too hard I guess
To use whatever fuel is left
At its best it's all the art of doubt
Well, I really don't know how we call this peace
'Cause it's a goddamn shame about the wall to wall wars
Pleading self-defence but the story's old
Murder's worth it, we're told
There's a promise on the way, yeah
I don't believe what they say

You said "don't let your heart give out"
No, I won't let my heart give out
You said "don't let your breath run out"
No, I won't let my breath run out

Well, it's magical, your meaningless
Habitual, mundane excess
At its best it's all the art of doubt
Doubt

Now we gotta take it upon ourselves
Next time the kick drum starts
Drag your mind from the gutter babe
All this isolation's sinister
So be kind to yourself
There will never be another you
There's just nobody else that's you
You said "don't let your heart give out"
No, I won't let my heart give out
You said "don't let your breath run out"
No, I won't let my breath run out

Well, it's true, I push too hard I guess
To use whatever fuel is left
Yeah it's true, I push too hard I guess
To use whatever fuel is left
Yeah it's true, I push too hard I guess
To use whatever fuel is left
At its best it's all the art of doubt
At its best it's all the art 

[Trackname: Underline the Black]

Underline the black around my eyes
In the dark with heavy chains over my heart
I just look, don't feel like myself at all
And I'm just waiting for the axe to fall
And I'm just waiting for the axe to fall

I came back so late but it was light
And they looked me up and down like an alien arrived
I just walked on by with my old guitar
And they're still waiting for their lives to start
And they're still waiting for their lives to start

I'm not sorry, I don't think of you that often

How can I explain, that feeling remains
When I looked at myself, I was somebody else
Mad visions and wild decisions were made
In the alleys that wind through the back of my mind
How can I forget, what reason is left
When I looked at myself, I was somebody else
Mad visions and wild decisions were made
In the alleys that wind through the back of my mind
Oh, with the black underlined, oh
Underline the black around my eyes
In the dark with heavy chains over my heart
I just look, don't feel like myself at all
And I'm just waiting for the axe to fall
And they're still waiting for their lives to start
And they're still waiting for their lives to start

I'm not sorry, I don't think of you that often

How can I explain, that feeling remains
When I looked at myself, I was somebody else
Mad visions and wild decisions were made
In the alleys that wind through the back of my mind
How can I forget, what reason is left
When I looked at myself, I was somebody else
Mad visions and wild decisions were made
In the alleys that wind through the back of my mind
Oh, with the black underlined
Oh, the back of my mind
Oh, with the black underlined
Oh

[Trackname: Dressed to Suppress]

And we keep speeding, and we keep speeding
And we keep crashing, and we keep crashing
And we keep reaching, and we keep reaching
And we keep crying 'til we start laughing
Long before my fall from grace
For a piece of me they paid
From the throat, I'm tied to you
All our vows the crowds undo

And the ones in the back cry "wait for me"
And the ones in the front cry "you're too slow, you're too slow"
And the ones who are weak cry "carry me"
And the ones who are strong cry "let me go, let me go"

We reach for the things we idolize
But the rings are just for show
Her beauty is a form of charity
Dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow

Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow
(Na na na na na)

Long before my fall from grace
For a piece of me they paid
From the throat I'm tied to you
All our vows the crowds undo

And the ones we ignore cry "come to me" (come to me)
Are the ones we adore cry "give me space, give me space"
And the ones who are cruel cry "beg for me" (beg for me)
And the ones they possess, they love the chase, love the chase

We reach for the things we idolize (idolize)
But the rings are just for show
Her beauty is a form of charity (charity)
Dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow

Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow

And we keep speeding, and we keep speeding (na na na na na)
And we keep crashing, and we keep crashing (na na na na na)
And we keep reaching, and we keep reaching (na na na na na)
And we keep crying 'til we start laughing (na na na na na

[Trackname: Risk]

So you got away, something brought you back
To the kid that you were
For a couple days everything you lacked
You possessed, it was yours

Started slow, started late
Started strong, then we lost faith
Started slow, started to lose control
The more we accelerate

With your hollow eyes, you keep coming back
It begins to transform
Can you spend the night? Can you be the raft?
In the eye of the storm?

Started slow, started late
Started strong, then we lost faith
Started slow, started to lose control
The more we accelerate, the more we accelerate

Can I send this kiss right to you now?
'Cause the risk belongs with you somehow
Can I return this kiss that you gave?
Already know it’s borrowed anyway
Was the risk I sent to you received?
All the words we say to be believed?
I’m already over the thrill of pursuit
Where can I take the risk I took with you?
Send this kiss to someone new?

So you're beaten up but you bounce back
It’s all part of the pull
And the story runs like a soundtrack
We repeat 'til we're full

Started slow, started late
Started strong, then we lost faith
Started slow, started to lose control
The more we accelerate, the more we accelerate


Can I send this kiss right to you now?
'Cause the risk belongs with you somehow
Can I return this kiss that you gave?
Already know it’s borrowed anyway
Was the risk I sent to you received?
All the words we say to be believed?
I’m already over the thrill of pursuit
Where can I take the risk I took with you?
Send this kiss to someone new?


So there's no way to hide
Find some daylight
There's another way to leave the Garden of Eden
And I'm inclined to try
Find some daylight
Hollow eyes
There's another way to leave the Garden of Eden
And I'm inclined to 

[Trackname: Seven Rules]

Come on, angel, come and save us
Let me see sunrise
Give me something for the one thing
We immortalized
Gaze upon you, turning into
Some desired doll
I'll be there to come and shake you
When your will dissolves

My love
Come out of the woods
Come out of the woods
Now darling
We're out of the woods
We're out of the woods

You're safe in my mind
Some antiquated tune
In my heart some ancient song
A song too blue to even use

Come on inside, it's a long ride
'80s limousine
I'll be tongue-tied, you'll be cross-eyed
On the grainy screen
With a token appreciation
Amateur cigar
Steel-plated, silver-painted
Novelty guitar
For you, well
Isn't it good and isn't it shit?
They lured us away from the beach
And onto the cruise ship

I lied, I lied
And never grew
To be made a lonely child
The seven rules you need to know
In my mind
Some antiquated tune
In my heart some ancient song
A song too blue to even use

I remember the beat and the sound of the bass
When you played all alone
Every possible dream in the head that you held
And the hands that you hold
I remember the beat and the sound of the bass
When you played all alone
Every possible dream in the head that you held
And the hands that you hold

[Trackname: Holding Out]

Holding out for the right time
What if the right time never arrives?
Always waiting on the sidelines
When is it my time
To be the one, the one, the one?

Holding out for the right time
My whole lifetime slowly goes by
Always waiting on the sidelines
When is it my time
To be the one, the one, the one?

What are you doing tonight?
You can't just scroll through pictures and hide
What do you wanna do right now
Right now, right now, right now

All that's happened filling up my days
All that's coming up, so far away
In between, I'm always holding out
Am I ever gonna be here now?
All that's happened filling up my days
All that's coming up, so far away
In between, I'm always holding out
Am I ever gonna be here now?
Holding out for the right time
That second lifetime never arrives
Always waiting for perfection
Where affection cannot be won
Be won, be won

Holding out for the right time
That second lifetime never arrives
Always waiting on the sidelines
When is it my time
To be the one, the one, the one?

What are you doing tonight?
So what are you doing tonight?
You can't just scroll through pictures and hide
What do you wanna do right
Yeah, what do you wanna do right now
Right now, right now, right now

All that's happened filling up my days
All that's coming up, so far away
In between, I'm always holding out
Am I ever gonna be here now?
All that's happened filling up my days
All that's coming up, so far away
In between, I'm always holding out

All that's coming up, so far away
In between, I'm always holding out

[Trackname: Anticipate]

What did you plan?
What did you anticipate?
All you demand to find
Spiraling down, falling behind
No tomorrow
When you're ahead of your time
What did you want to know?
How does it end? How does it go?

From the bottom I fled
But the stars overhead
Led me away from the ruin
I must say that I was a wreck
Hit the bottom I guess
But the words you once said
Led me away from the ruin
Second sight up ahead

I couldn't withstand
I couldn't anticipate
How low I would go
What did I miss? I didn't know
I didn't know
Now what do you anticipate?
Another catastrophe
Coming around, following me
From the bottom I fled
But the stars overhead
Led me away from the ruin
I must say that I was a wreck
Hit the bottom I guess
But the words you once said
Led me away from the ruin
Second sight up ahead

[Trackname: No Lights on the Horizon]

It's true, I'm flawed
It's all my fault
I made every mistake, paper walls break
And it's all falling through

The past, it isn't far away
It's part of all of us, it's here to stay
I'm more than able to follow through
I'm just not for everyone, I might be just for you

If it wasn't for your kindness
I think I might be dead
If it wasn't for the way you said
"Oh, stay with me instead"
No lights on the horizon
No sign of what's ahead
If it wasn't for your kindness lately
I'd never get out of bed

The past, it isn't far away
In spite of all of us, it's here to stay
I'm more than able to follow through
Just not for everyone, maybe just for you
If it wasn't for your kindness
I think I might be dead
If it wasn't for the way you said
"Oh, stay with me instead"
No lights on the horizon
No sign of what's ahead
If it wasn't for your kindness lately
I'd never get out of bed

It's true, I'm flawed
It's all my fault
I made every mistake, paper walls break
And it's all falling through

If it wasn't for your kindness

If it wasn't for the way you said
"Oh, stay with me instead"
No lights on the horizon
No sign of what's ahead
If it wasn't for your kindness lately
I'd never get out of bed
Never get out of bed
Never get out of bed
Never get out of
