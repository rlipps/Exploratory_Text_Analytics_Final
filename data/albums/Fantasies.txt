[Trackname: Help I'm Alive]

I tremble
They're gonna eat me alive
If I stumble
They're gonna eat me alive

Can you hear my heart beatin' like a hammer?
Beatin' like a hammer?

Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps beatin' like a hammer
Hard to be soft, tough to be tender
Come take my pulse, the pace is on a runaway train
Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps

Beatin' like a hammer
Beatin' like a hammer
Beatin' like a hammer
Beatin' like a hammer

If we're still alive
My regrets are few
If my life is mine
What shouldn't I do?
I get wherever I'm going
I get whatever I need
While my blood's still flowing
And my heart still beats
Beatin' like a hammer
Beatin' like a hammer

Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps beatin' like a hammer
Hard to be soft, tough to be tender
Come take my pulse, the pace is on a runaway train
Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps

Beatin' like a hammer
Beatin' like a hammer
Beatin' like a hammer
Beatin' like a hammer

If we're still alive
My regrets are few
If my life is mine
What shouldn't I do?
I get wherever I'm going
I get whatever I need
While my blood's still flowing
And my heart still beats
Beatin' like a hammer
Beatin' like a hammer (Beatin' like a hammer)
Beatin' like a hammer (Beatin' like a hammer)
Beatin' like a hammer (Beatin' like a hammer)

I tremble
They're gonna eat me alive
If I stumble
They're gonna eat me alive

Can you hear my heart beatin' like a hammer?
Beatin' like a hammer?
Beatin' like a hammer
Beatin' like a hammer

Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps beatin' like a 

[Trackname: Sick Muse]

Watch out, Cupid stuck me with a sickness
Pull your little arrows out and let me live my life
You better watch out, Cupid stuck me with a sickness
Pull your little arrows out
Let me live my life
The one I'd better lead
All the blondes are fantasies

And we looked at them eleven ways
You said, "Look at me," and looked away
And you wrote the song I wanna play
I'll write you harmony in C

Everybody, everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody, everybody just wanna play the lead
Everybody, everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody, everybody just wanna play the lead
Play the lead, play the lead

Watch out, Cupid, money is a sick muse
Pull your little arrows out and let me live my life
She said, "I'm with stupid"
Money is a sick muse
Pull your little arrows out
Let me live my life
The one I'd better lead
All the blondes are fantasies
And we looked at them eleven ways
You said, "Look at me," and looked away
And you wrote the song I wanna play
I'll write you harmony in C

Everybody, everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody, everybody just wanna play the lead
Everybody, everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody, everybody just wanna play the lead
Play the lead, play the lead

I'll write you harmony in C

Everybody, everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody, everybody just wanna play the lead
Everybody, everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody, everybody just wanna play the lead
Play the lead, play the 

[Trackname: Satellite Mind]

Hold it, I'm about to drop off
Let me tell you my last thought
Drift into a deep fog
Lost where I forgot to hold it
I can feel you most when I'm alone

Coming home 'cause I want to
Hang out with a starlet
Stare up at the ceiling
Preview of a screening
Flashback of a feeling
Sick sense of a calling
Heard you fuck through the wall
I heard you fuck

When I'm bored
I send vibrations
In your direction
Through the satellite mind
When I'm bored
I send vibrations
In your direction
Through the satellite mind
I'm not suicidal, I just can't get out of bed
I drift into a deep fog
Lost where I forgot to hold it
I can feel you most when I'm alone
I can feel your ghost when I'm alone

Coming home 'cause I want to
Hang out with a starlet
Stare up at the ceiling
Hiding and revealing
Flashback of a feeling
Sick sense of a calling
Heard you fuck through the wall
I heard you fuck

When I'm bored
I send vibrations
In your direction
Through the satellite mind
When I'm bored
I send vibrations
In your direction
Through the satellite mind
When your voice
Became vibrations
Through the satellite mind
Through the satellite mind
It sounded like mine, mine, mine
It sounded like, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
It sounded like mine, mine, mine
It sounded like you, you
Ooh, ooh
It sounded like mine
It sounded like, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
It sounded like
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Trackname: Twilight Galaxy]

Did they tell you, "You should grow up,"
When you wanted to dream?
Did they warn you, "Better shape up
If you want to succeed."
I don't know about you
Who are they talking to?
They're not talking to me

I'm higher than high
Lower than deep
I'm doing it wrong
Singing along
I'm higher than high
Lower than deep
I'm doing it wrong
Singing along

Did I ask you for attention
When affection is what I need?
Thinking sorrow is perfection
I would wallow 'til you told me
There's no glitter in the gutter
There's no twilight galaxy
Go higher than high, ooh
Go lower than deep, ooh
Keep doing it wrong, ooh
Keep singing along, ooh
Go higher than high, ooh
Go lower than deep, ooh
Keep doing it wrong, ooh
Keep singing along, ooh

I'm alright, come on, baby
I've seen all the demons that you've got
If you're not alright now, come on, baby
I'll pick you up and take, take you where you want
Anywhere you want
Anywhere you want
Anywhere you want
Anything you want

I'm higher than high
Lower than deep
I'm doing it wrong
Singing along
Go higher than high, ooh
Go lower than deep, ooh
Keep doing it wrong, ooh
Keep singing along, ooh
Go higher than high, ooh
Go lower than deep, ooh
Keep doing it wrong, ooh
Keep singing along, ooh
I'm higher than

All the gold and the guns and the girls

All the boys, all the choices in the world

I remember when we were gambling to win
Everybody else said, "Better luck next time"

Everybody else said, "Better luck next time"
I don't wanna bend, let the bad girls bend
I just wanna be your friend
Why you givin' me a hard time?

[Trackname: Gimme Sympathy]

Get hot
Get too close to the flame
Wild, open space
Talk like an open book
Sign me up
Got no time to take a picture
I'll remember someday
All the chances we took

We're so close
To something better left unknown
We're so close
To something better left unknown
I can feel it in my bones

Gimme sympathy
After all of this is gone
Who would you rather be
The Beatles or The Rolling Stones?
Oh, seriously
You're gonna make mistakes, you're young
Come on, baby, play me something
Like "Here Comes the Sun"
Come on, baby, play me something
Like "Here Comes the Sun"
Don't go
Stay with the all-unknown
Stay away from the hooks
All the chances we took

We're so close
To something better left unknown
We're so close
To something better left unknown
I can feel it in my bones

Gimme sympathy
After all of this is gone
Who would you rather be
The Beatles or The Rolling Stones?
Oh, seriously
You're gonna make mistakes, you're young
Come on, baby, play me something

After all of this is gone
Who would you rather be

Come on, baby, play me something
Like "Here Comes the Sun"
Come on, baby, play me something

[Trackname: Collect Call]

If the fire's out, baby
How you gonna keep me warm?
Supposing you let me
With the door wide open, no one can leave

I know it's a lie, I want it to be true
The rest of the ride is riding on you
Over goodbyes, we'll buy some place for...

Wishing you could keep me closer
I'm a lazy dancer
When you move, I move with you
Wishing you could keep me closer
I'm a lazy dancer
When you move, I move with you

If somebody's got soul
If somebody's got soul
If somebody's got soul
You've got to make them move
Make them move
I know it's a lie, I want it to be true
The rest of the ride is riding on you
Over goodbyes, we'll buy some place for...

Wishing you could keep me closer
I'm a lazy dancer
When you move, I move with you
Wishing you could keep me closer

[Trackname: Front Row]

I'm in the front row with a bottle
Don't know what I can't decide
I'm in the front row, I'm a model
Don't know what I can't describe

Burnout stars, they shine so bright
All of us
Burnout stars, they shine so bright

He's not perfect, he's my hero
Smashing the piano, spitting on the front row
Chronic confrontation, psychic conversation
Radical compassion, louder than the action of
All of us

Burnout stars, they shine so bright
All of us
Burnout stars, they shine so bright
All the stars
Burnout stars, they shine so bright
All of us
Burnout stars, they shine so bright

Don't know what I can't describe

Burnout stars, they shine so bright
All of us
Burnout stars, they shine so bright

He's not perfect, he's a victim
Of his occupation, social insulation
Secret intervention, charge him with possession
I just wanna watch him
Make or break and beat them

[Trackname: Blindness]

Send us a blindfold, send us a blade
Tell the survivors, help is on the way
I was a blind fool, never complained
All the survivors singing in the rain

I was the one with the world at my feet
Goddess of battle, leave it up to me

Find us a trap door, find us a plane
Tell the survivors, help is on the way
I was a blind fool, I never complained
All the survivors singing in the rain

I was the one with the world at my feet
Goddess of battle, leave it up to me

What it is and where it stops, nobody knows
You gave me a life I never chose
I wanna leave but the world won't let me go
Wanna leave but the world won't let me go
What it is and where it stops, nobody knows
You gave me a life I never chose
I wanna leave but the world won't let me go
Wanna leave but the world won't let me go
What it is and where it stops, nobody knows
You gave me a life I never chose
I wanna leave but the world won't let me go
Wanna leave but the world won't let me go
What it is and where it stops, nobody knows
You gave me a life I never chose

I was the one with the world at my feet
Goddess of battle, leave it up to me
Leave it up to me
Leave it up to me

[Trackname: Stadium Love]

Wanna make a bet?
We'll be neck to neck
Taking off the gloves
Spider versus bat
Tiger versus rat
Rabbit versus dove

Wanna make a bet?
Odds are neck to neck
Taking off the gloves
Spider versus bat
Tiger versus rat
Owl versus dove

Every living thing pushed into the ring
Fight it out to wow the crowd
Guess you thought you could just watch
No one's getting out

Without stadium love
Without stadium love
Wanna make a trade?
Cougar for a snake
Wanna fall in love?
Wanna make a deal?
Angel versus eel
Owl versus dove

Every living thing pushed into the ring
Fight it out to wow the crowd
Guess you thought you could just watch
No one's getting out

We've got stadium love
We've got stadium love
We've got stadium love
