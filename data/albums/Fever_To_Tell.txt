I'm Rich
Like a hot noise
Rich, rich, rich
I'll take you out, boy
So stuck up
I wish you'd stick it to me
Flesh ripped off

Turning it
Beating no beat
The walls are always speaking
No one, no one, no one, no speaking at all!

She slipped
Down a rot drink
Well, unzipped
She doesn't exist
So unloved
I took 'em standing up
So stuck up
Ah
I'm Rich
Like a hot noise
Rich, rich, rich
I'll take you out, boy
I'll take you out, boy
Turning it
Beating no beat
The walls are always speaking
No one, no one, no one, no speaking at all!
Turning it
Beating no beat
The walls are always speaking
No one, no one, no one, no speaking at all!
Rich, rich, rich, rich, rich, 

[Trackname: Date With The Night]

I got a date with the night
Burning out my finger
Gonna catch the kids dry
Gonna walk on water
Buying out the fight
We're sweating in the winter
Both thighs squeeze tight

Choke, Choke, Choke
Choke, Choke, Choke
Choke, Choke, Choke
Choke, Choke, Choke
Choke, Choke, Choke

Don't tell me to fix her
Don't tell me to fix her
Just take a bite
No hanging no picture
Flying out my sight
Dropping brides at the altar
Both thighs squeeze tight

Choke, Choke, Choke
Choke, Choke, Choke
Choke, Choke, Choke
Choke, Choke, Choke
Choke, Choke, Choke

Both thighs squeeze tight
Both Thighs squeeze

[Trackname: Poor Song]
Baby I'm afraid of a lot of things but
I ain't scared of loving you
And baby I know you're afraid of a lot of things
But don't be scared of love, cause
People will say all kinds of things
But that don't mean a damn to me
Cause all I see is what's in front of me
And that's you
Well I've been dragged all over the place
I've taken hits time just don't erase
And baby I can see you've been fucked with too
But that don't mean your loving days are through
Cause people will say all kinds of things
But that don't mean a damn to me
Cause all I see is what's in front of me
And that's you
Well I may be just a fool
But I know you're just as cool
And cool kids, they belong
