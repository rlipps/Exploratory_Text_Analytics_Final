Gold Lion's gonna tell me where the light is
Gold Lion's gonna tell me where the light is
Take our hands out of control
Take our hands out of control

Now, tell me what you saw
Tell me what you saw
There was a crowd of seeds
Inside, outside
I must have done a dozen each
It was the height I grew
The weight, the shell was crushing you
I've been around a few

Tell me what you saw
I'll tell you what to
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh

Gold Lion's gonna tell me where the light is

Take our hands out of control

Outside, Inside
This is a moon without a tide
We'll build a fire in your eyes
We'll build a fire
When the cover's getting brighter, cold desire
Makes a moon without a tide

Tell me what you saw
I'll tell you what to
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh

[Trackname: Way Out]

Lies and love
Lies, love
Bedwetting son of the great heat
It's all over me
It's all under me
The face ain't making what the mouth needs
Wonder more
Want, more than we did before
Try the new tease
Well, quiet you
Get over me
The shit is running and it runs deep

I'm way out
Way out
Way out
Way out
When you mean it on the inside
You still can't get to me

Fits around me so tight, nuh oh
Fits around me so tight, nuh oh

Fits around me
Fits around me

[Trackname: Fancy]

I find it in an atlas
Or flipping over old news
Check what's in the trash bag

Well, just another part of you
Well, just another part of you
I beg your pardon, beg your pardon, beg your pardon

Blame me for where you are
Well, tell me what I gotta lose
About to get fancy

Well, just another part of you
Well, just another part of you
I beg your pardon, beg your pardon, beg your pardon

Like a perfect fit
Didn't need eyes

Watching from the nooks, ah
We went over it
Like a perfect fit
Didn't need eyes
Didn't need eyes
Watching from the nooks, ah

Well, just another part of you

Don't touch, can't sleep with the lights on
Touch, kid, how you surprise me
Now roll, kid, rock your body off!
You're something like a phenomena
Something like an astronomer
Roll, kid, rock your body off!

Something like a phenomena, baby
Something like a phenomena
Something like a phenomena, baby

Don't fall asleep with the motor running
She'll make you sweat in the water

Turn yourself around
You weren't invited

Good, good things
Happen in bad towns
Good, good things
Happen in bad towns

Run away, run away, you want it
Run away, run away, you want it
Run away, any way you want it
Run away, run away, you want it

What, what did you do to your back?
Kept soft thoughts, cut lips, can't get 'em back
Junk, jump off, too much talk
Old hope breeds
Cold needs
Undress old keys

Run away, run away, you want it
Run away, run away, you want it
Run away, any way you want it
Run away, run away, you want it
Gone, all alone
I've got a call from the bear
Gonna take all his honey, honey
Gone, all alone

Gonna take all his honey, honey
Gone, all alone

[Trackname: Cheated Hearts]

Cheated by the opposite of love
Held on high from up, up, up above
Kept my high from the second one
Kept my eye on the first one
Now, take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day

Well I'm
Taka-taka-taka-taka-takin' it off
And she's
Taka-taka-taka-taka-takin' it off
And he's
Taka-taka-taka-taka-takin' it off
And we're
Taka-taka-taka-taka-takin' it off

Sometimes, I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well, I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well, I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well, I think that I'm bigger than the sound
She'll take on high
She'll take on high

Well sometimes, I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well, I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well, I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well, I think that I'm bigger than the sound

Cheated by the opposite of love
Held on high from up, up, up above
Kept my high from the second one
Kept my eye on the first one

I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day

[Trackname: Dudley]

Hot cold season, gonna sink in my sweat
No one isn't ever gonna make it there yet
If you can't even cope with it
Then you'll pass me by
And you'll take it over
And make it mine

Fast slow living is a-holding me back
Wishing that my baby never told me that
I can't even cope to make it last
Then you'll pass me by
And you'll take it over
And you'll make it mine

Then you want it a-, want it a-, want it again
Then you want it a-, want it a-, want it again
Then you want it a-, want it a-, want it again
Then you want it a-, want it a-, want it again

My dear, you've been used
I'm breaking the news
Well, love nearly beat us
I'm thinking like you
Well, I'm thinking of you
Well, love follows near us
Can love really steer us?
Oh, can it be true?
Oh, can it be true?
Lost all reason from playing your games
Better quit staring 'cause you're looking the same
I can't even cope to make a change
Then you'll pass me by
And you'll take it over
And make it mine

Use me up
Use me up
Taper off and I'm had

[Trackname: Mysteries]

My arms are all twisted
The only thing I miss is
I messed up
I missed it
I messed up
The missing of you
It's getting to sound like
They've seen you around
With her

No mystery
No mystery
No mysteries

Everyone knows the secret-est code of mine
They'll tell all my friends
And they'll tell all my enemies too

Mystery
No mysteries
No mysteries
No mystery
No mystery
No mysteries
Take it away, Nick!


I don't even know what it's like not to go back to you
I don't even know who
I like
Less
You or me
You or me
You or me
It's anyone's, anyone's guess
It's anyone's, anyone's guess

Stress, stress
Stress, stress
Stress, stress
Stress, stress
Stress

[Trackname: Sweets]

Green shadow, water weight all o-, all over me
The end will shelter me away from me
Can we meet again, meet and meet and meet and meet again?
Can you fill the can, if you can't fill me?

Who you following?
Who you starting to move like?
Who you falling for?
Who you falling for?
Whose lies?
Who you following?
Who you falling for?
This sound's on your side

Secret blue, purple, pink and green right over it
Well, hold on 'cause the coldest hasn't thawed yet
Well, if we meet again, meet and meet and meet and meet again
Can you catch the can, if you can't will it?

How will you want something to hit with?
Spinning again and again and again
What's your crime?
What's your crime?
Well, how will you want?
How will she sin?
We're spinning again and again and again
What's your crime?
What's your, what's your, what's your, what's your
What's your crime?
Crime, crime
What's your, what's your, what's your, what's your
What's your crime?

[Trackname: Warrior]

When it's missing, then you want it more
It isn't right
Turning, turning out the door
And back to this
Leave it like it was before
And let me out
Must've been the end of the story

Giving it all, giving it all away
You're gonna wake up someone
Well, study it all, the wings, the crowd, your face
You're gonna end up like one
Well, trouble at home, travel the way, you say
The road don't like me
Well, travel away, travel it all away
The road's gonna end on me

Man, they like me
'Cause I'm a warrior, a warrior
Stand on my feet
Dance the warrior, the warrior
Where would I be?
I'd be a warrior, a warrior
Now the strangers have caught on
And they're riding in the backseat
The river's gonna wash all
Yeah, the river, it spoke to me
It told me I'm small
And I swallowed it down
If I make it at all
I'll make you want me

Well, trouble at home, travel the way, you say
The road don't like me
Well, travel it all, travel it all away
The road's gonna get on me
And I'm small
The road's gonna get on me
Well, if it gets it at all
The road's gonna end on me

Like a warrior, a warrior
Dance the warrior, the warrior

[Trackname: Turn Into]

I know what I know
I know on the car ride down
I hear it in my head real low

Turn into
The only thing I ever
Turn into
Hope I do
Turn into you

I know what I know
Well, I know that girl you found
Keeps that kind of window closed

She'll turn into
The only thing you ever
Turn into
Hope I do
Turn into you

Can't say why I kept this from you
My, those quiet eyes become you
Leave it where it can't remind us
Turn this all around behind us, oh
Well, I know
Well, I'll fall right in to keep you out
I'd like to tell you all about it
I know what I know
I know this last time 'round
I'll hear it in my head real low

Turn into
The only thing you ever know
The only thing you ever know

I know what I know
Well, I know
Ah,
