[Trackname: My Brother Had A Birthday]

I swear to God
6 AM geekin', in the stu' wit' it
My bronem wit' me, hm
Shit a movie we livin', that's for real
Protect me from the fake
Been through it all, I knew I was gon' get it one day
Homicide out there, but I still went on that playscape

Product of the field
We ain't had no money, but had a loaded steel
She ain't really know his pain, she left him when it's real
See, niggas think they was gangster, they geekin' off the pills
Detectives, they be honest, they think brodie hе was on a drill
And that first nigga who died, gave him a birthday wish
Get up supеr close, I swear that glizzy kiss
Brother told me he was smiling, laughing when he seen him twitch
Got lot of killers in this mansion, girl, don't let 'em in

And I saved a hundred racks before I hit the stage
And I know a hundred rats, so I watch what I say
And she know two hundred racks ain't worth a hundred bricks
It's hard to stand around the pastor, got too many sins
Save me, brother know I'm going through it all
He gon' par with me
And if I win, you know we all win
I had the junkies calling at the same time I had the labels calling
They told me watch my back
They think that I can't watch myself
I fought for the grind, I ain't never fought for help
I woke up and went to that corner where my brother died
But I can't complain 'cause we spin back right there, many times
I'm nauseous, I'm gasping for some air
Ain't makin' racks, but still she sittin' in hotels
I can't tell you what I did 'cause niggas tell and bitches tell
Cut off the loose ends, I was lookin' for some clientele
Life on the dirty, dirty Jane, I swear my block be so famous
She ain't wanna come around, she said, "It's too dangerous"
I said, "My lifestyle is amazing"
I learned how to get it from the struggle, I ain't basic
Product of the field
We ain't had no money, but had a loaded steel
She ain't really know his pain, she left him when it's real
See, niggas think they was gangster, they geekin' off the pills
Detectives, they be honest, they think brodie he was on a drill
And that first nigga who died, gave him a birthday wish
Get up super close, I swear that glizzy kiss
Brother told me he was smiling, laughing when he seen him twitch
Got lot of killers in this mansion, girl, don't let 'em in

I seen my OG cry
It be hurting her but she know that I'm livin' life
It's just the fact we come from a bloody scene, it's a scary site
Don't get caught on the fences, green beam, it's on sight
And we ain't never call for no protectors
My brother know I'm there with him
Yeah, he there with me
Lot of niggas ain't gang, but say they gang, so it's , fifty
I write you everyday, "Do you miss me?"
Look what we done, baby, we got history
Look what we done, nigga, we got history
We was loadin' G-Locks way before fifteen
Fell in love with mmm-money route, my main squeeze
Feeling safe with DP on the drill, I know he gon' squeeze
We from the sea so I'll show you how to swing a rod
Got brothers across the street, for me, they go retarded
Dumb way, that dumb way, we know that death is promised
Bro, he got a sweater in the middle of August
Oh, you brought out the biggest gun?
Product of the field
Mhm, mhm, mhm-mhm
Mhm-mhm
For real, though!

[Trackname: The Enterprising Catalyst]
Tell us a little
Or tell us not too much
Tell us carefully
Understatedly
What will be your
Word choices
And tone?
Who'll come out on top?
Who is the enterprising catalyst?
Who is the enterprising catalyst?
Who is the enterprising catalyst?

[Trackname: Grandfather's Jacket]
I remember winter
When I wore my grandpa's jacket
I remember some time
When I wore no jacket at all
Ah
(And now) And now in the deepest embrace of summertime
And now in the deepest embrace of summertime
Under layers and layers of onionskin
Under layers and layers of onionskin
I remember wintertime
When I wore my grandpa's jacket
I remember the springtime
When I wore no jacket at all
Ah
And here in the deepest embrace of summertime
And now in the deepest embrace of summertime
Under layers and layers of onionskin
Only layers and layers of onionskin
Only layers and layers of onionskin
Only layers and layers of onionskin

[Trackname: After Santa Monica Boulevard]
Does Sheryl Crow know
After Santa Monica Boulevard she had not to give?
And I don’t believe her when she says it’s time to lighten up
Not the way that I believe Don Henley when he tells me
Not the way that I believe Don Henley when he tells me
And I don’t believe her when she says it’s time to lighten up
Not the way I believe Don Henley when he tells me
Not the way I believe Don Henley when he tells me

[Trackname: Dahlonegabhama]
The lyrics are artistically obscured beyond recognition

[Trackname: Further On Down The Strip]
One two
What's me is me, me, me
Stranger is what I see, see, see
Further
On down the strip
I can see I can see
Further
On down the strip
I can see I can see
Aah

[Trackname: Katydids Calling]
The bugs are crowning me
In a halo 'round my head
And the katydid is calling
All around the field
And I'm trying to fall away
The bees are crowning me
In a halo around my head
And the air conditioning's on
And we talk about it
But I'm trying to fall away

[Trackname: Twenty-Foot Stalks]
I go out to the shopping mall
Parking lot at four in the morn
All you can hear is sprinkles
On pavement and lights overhead
On twenty-foot stalks
But I'm gonna go and climb some trees
Out in the woods
So fuck the police
They're checking ambitions down by
The on-ramp at exit at exit fourteen

[Trackname: We Could Cling]
We could cling
Cowering
To one another
We could cry
You and I
But oh
But I wonder
Is oh
Is, baby, be friends with you
We could cling
Cowering
To one another
We could cry
You and I
But oh
But all I wanna do
Is oh
Is, baby, be friends with you
Is, baby, be friends with you

[Trackname: The Love-Prayer Book]
Oh-oh wa-ah
Oh-oh-oh wa-ah

[Trackname: To Give It Weight]
Then he gave it cartilage
To give it shape
Then he gave a heart to it
To give it weight
Then he gave it cartilage
Then he gave it cartilage
Then he gave it cartilage
Then he gave it cartilage
To give it shape
Then he gave a heart to it
To give it weight
Then he gave it cartilage
Then he gave it cartilage
Then he gave it cartilage

[Trackname: Here Comes The Summer King]
Three blocks west
At the edge of the lot
Three brown finches
Know a special spot
Feathers ruffle
To protect slender throats
And there is no wind there
Hey!
Here comes the summer
In a week of rain
Put it in your pocket
All is living again
Here comes to summer
Here comes the sizz-ummer
Here comes the summer
Here comes the summer

[Trackname: Her Freezings And Thawings]
The flowers are all blooming in the cemetery
Very fertile things are buried
Very fertile things are rising to the surface
And their heads now break the soft new ground
Penetrating icebergs, and their crests are dawning
By her freezings and thawings
The roses that lay in Memoriam Bay
They lay wilted
But look what supple daffodil did
She looks just like a drawing of an areola
In my seventh grade anatomy textbook
And college smells like vomit
'Cause someone puked upon it
In the stairwell last night
Many times
But it's probably gonna be alright
From New England soil new rocks fruit each spring
Her soil cleaves and out she rings
Her soil cleaves and out she brings
Like a once ago
Like a once-swallowed bowling ball
Like a long ago once-swallowed bowling ball
And their heads are brought to the surface
Penetrating icebergs, and their crests are dawning
By her freezings and thawings
By her freezings and thawings

[Trackname: We Two Feared The Storm]
(We two feared)
I fled
I don't know why
I fled
I don't know why
We two feared the storm
I don't know why
We two feared (I fled) the storm
I don't know why
We two feared (I fled) the storm
I don't know why
We two feared the storm
We two feared the storm

[Trackname: I Am Going To See It]
I go
To the place
Where no one goes
Today
I go
To a place
Where no one goes
Today
And when I go out
I am going to see
Said I am going to see it
Said I am going to see it through
Said and when I go out
I am going to see it
Yeah I am going to see it
I am going to see it through

[Trackname: Fake Folks]
I nearly lost it
Around the bend
How can you hold onto something
That can't be held
And when I look at water
I think that it should be still
How can you think that water
Should be still
Water's not gonna be still
And when I go outside
When I go for a ride
Something catches me

[Trackname: Like Once-Heated Milk]
With eyes like once heated milk
With the film of skin
In the simplicity of your need
You live all over me
You climb me like a tower
It's something like certainty
For you
Tables turning out in the cold
I'm left out in the cold
With eyes like once-heated milk
With the skin of film
With eyes like once heated milk
With the film of skin
In the simplicity of your need
You live all over me
Admire you like a tower
It's something like your simplicity
Admire you like a tower
It's something like that

[Trackname: O! You Hungering Infants]
With all the ire
Of the dispossessed reclaiming
I starved you
Those hurdles are not open windows
You'll probably kill yourself doing that
And he's hot on tested blood
And inspires you so
Not under my roof
But not under this roof
With all the ire
Of the dispossessed reclaiming
I scold

[Trackname: Morning Better Last!]
(One, two, three)
That idea'll go nowhere fast
I'll not follow it down
I'm not leaving 'til morning
And morning better last
I'm not leaving 'til morning
And morning better last
I'm not leaving 'til morning
And morning better last
