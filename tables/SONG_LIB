Shame on you
Shame on you
Hey, your love away from me
You can't hide

Hey
Your love away from me
Hey
Shame on you
Your love away from me

Shame on you

Shame on you


My favorite song
My favorite song
Reminds me of the first time I went to space
It was such a long journey
It took hours, days, years
But when it was over...
Oh, it takes me back
That takes me back to the first time
I stepped into space
You were there
You were there with all my best friends
I remember
I remember the look on your face
The way you said, with your eyes
You said

And then I slipped out of the Sun's sphere of influence
Nothing was happening
It was so dizzying
And then you took everything from me
I was left here, a shell of my self
I was left here to pick up the pieces
And every piece was...
Love, give me love
That's when you saved me
At the last possible moment
You brought your big hand out
And scooped up my ship
And took me home
That day you gave a new faith
In how people can save one another
Instead of always putting out their hands
To crush

When you're out in space
You feel so light
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
When you're out in space
You feel so light
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
When you're out in space
You feel so light

Ready?
Ready
Welcome
Step through the doors
Sliding doors
Okay I’m serious
I’m just playing
It changed
Mystery solved
You can see everything from here
Isn't it beautiful?
It is beautiful
I bet you know what you need to know by now
Just take a moment
I must admit your technology is wonderful
I've never seen anything like this
Will you accept our friendship?
Without hesitation
I didn’t say we could promise anything more than that
Unless you’re seeing everything for the first time
Alright
That is everything
Step through the door
I have already stepped through the door
Then welcome
I see no need for this
Who's that?
I wasn't to talk to you
Who is that?
Who's talking?
I want to talk to you about a few things
Is that a voice in my head?
Help me understand why your friends are all afraid
Help me understand why your friends are all afraid
Get out of my head
They’re from New York City
By way of the interstellar highway
Doesn’t he rock you?
Thank you very much
I really appreciate it
Okay I’m done

Starry eyes, doot doot

Waiting in the rain
All night on the floor

Stay in the shadows
Cheer at the gallows
This is a round-up

This is a low-flying panic attack
Sing the song on the jukebox that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live

Red crosses on wooden doors
If you float, you burn
Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers

Sing the song of sixpence that goes

Then into your life, there comes a darkness
There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
And all we trapped rag doll cloth people
We are helpless to resist
Into our darkest hour

But it was just a laugh, just a laugh, just a laugh, just a laugh
Even at this angle, and so we crumble
A ten ton head made of wet sand, oh, this dread circumference
You've gotta be kidding me, the grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, in the glass, it was just a laugh, just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is, in split infinity

Then into your life, there comes a darkness
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears

Now as I go upon my way
So let me go upon my way
Born of a light, born of a light
The wind rushing 'round my open heart
An open ravine with my spirit wide
Totally alive and my spirit light
Through an open doorway
Across a street to another life
And catching my reflection
In a window, switching on a light
One I didn't know, totally alive, totally released

Waking, waking up from shutdown
From a thousand years of sleep

A frightening place, the faces are concrete grey
And I'm wondering, should I turn around?

One we learned from nuns and such
I won't believe, not a word you speak
Just make it sweet to hear
Let's pour wine in coffee cups
And drive around the neighborhood
And shine the headlights on houses
Until all the news is good

(Oh no!) What would your father do?
(Oh no!) What would the neighbors think?

Roaming blackouts on the street

Lining up around the block
Back pockets full of dynamite

Indifference

Adolescence will work for less
Trade and experience
Easily influenced
They're wanted before they've changed
The figure must be fresh
If their act's not raw
Without a second guess
People say “step down”
Why they still at it?
When they still look good
More hate towards the women
That's showbiz
They will invest
With the promise
That the star is tender
Mature skill just as attractive as somebody new
Developing skills

All night I lay on my pillow and pray
For my boss to stop me in the hallway
Lay my head on his shoulder and say
""Son, I've been hearing good things""

I wake up without warning
And go flying around the house
In my Sauvignon, fierce, freaking out
Take a forty-five minute shower and kiss the mirror

Say, ""Look at me
Baby, we'll be fine
All we gotta do is be brave
And be kind""

I put on an argyle sweater and put on a smile
I don't know how to do this

I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
Baby come over, I need entertaining
I had a stilted, pretending day
Lay me down and say something pretty
Lay me back down where I wanted to stay

Just say something perfect
Something I can steal
Say, ""Look at me

All we gotta do is be brave
And be kind""

And you spill Jack and Coke in my collar

I’m gonna dry all my tears today
Got no patience for old pain
Tell my friends to shake the sad parade
I’m gonna lift up and fly away
It’s been far too long
I'd wait in vain for better days, than pouring rain
I’m gonna stand up and drop these chains
I’ve been held in place with wire and lace
And waltzed around the drain

When you’ve got no time
You’re gonna want it back
You’re gonna act so bad
You’re gonna act so badly

I wanna love you back so bad
I wanna love you back so bad
I wanna love you back so bad
You’re everyone I never had
I wanna love you back so bad
I wanna love you back so bad
I wanna love you back so bad
You’re everyone I never had

I’m gonna cut out and waste the day
Dump some diamonds in the lake
Truly appreciate my luck can change
I’m gonna strip off your whitewash stain
It’s a thin disguise that barely hides
Your painted face that falls away
I’m gonna dry all my tears today
I’ve been held in place with wire and lace
And waltzed around the drain

When you’ve got no time
You’re gonna want it back
You’re gonna want it badly
When you feel this light
When you feel this happy
You’re gonna act so bad
You’re gonna act so badly
I wanna love you back so bad
I wanna love you back so bad
I wanna love you back so bad
You’re everyone I never had
I wanna love you back so bad
I wanna love you back so bad

So what is this so-so-society?
Still drinking that Kool-Aid like it's free
Still popping that poison, po-po-po
Political you know how it goes

Is this dystopia?
Is this dystopia?
Is this dystopia?
Is this dystopia?

Fame is the bait
(And the switch is the look in your eye)
What will you ask?
(While we wait for the past to arrive)
Fame is the bait
(And the switch is your head in the sand)
Time that we waste
(While we wait for the future to land)

Die happy
In the summertime
So happy
I could die
This city is thick with common thieves
Still passing around the same disease
Who's running this town and why are we?
Still drinking that Kool-Aid like it's free

In this dystopia

Fame is the bait

Time that we waste
(While we wait for the future to land)

Fame is the bait
(And the switch is your desolate smile)
If I need it
(Though we shelter the thing for a while)
Fame is the bait
(And the switch is the touch of your hand)
Time that we waste
(While we wait for the future to land)

It hurts to turn the radio on
My stamina’s gone, my spirit is weak
Because every time I start to move on
Keep hearing that song, I’m brought to my knees
To permanently see in reverse
Take the remorse out of defeat
Because everything that’s under my skin
Where I end and begin still belongs to me

I’m fine to sit and stare at the door
Can’t run anymore, too weary to stand
Abandon the effect with the cause
My life is on pause, it’s out of my hands
To perfectly perform in reverse
There’s no way to rehearse, there’s nothing to plan
Because everything that’s under my skin
Where I end and begin, that’s who I am

Oh, only silence can restore
The sense of place I had before
Oh, only silence can repair
My sense of self I lost somewhere
Oh oh, oh, only silence can restore
The sense of place I had before
Oh, only silence can repair
My sense of self I lost somewhere

Because the last time I let myself feel this way
It was a long, long time ago
And now we get so scared, and we get so scared
To be nowhere left alone
Because the last time you let yourself feel this way
It was a long, long time ago
And now we get so scared, and we get so scared

Murder's worth it, we're told

In the dark with heavy chains over my heart
I just look, don't feel like myself at all

And they looked me up and down like an alien arrived

So you got away, something brought you back
To the kid that you were
For a couple days everything you lacked
You possessed, it was yours

Started slow, started late
Started strong, then we lost faith
Started slow, started to lose control
The more we accelerate

With your hollow eyes, you keep coming back
It begins to transform
Can you spend the night? Can you be the raft?
In the eye of the storm?

Started slow, started late
Started strong, then we lost faith
Started slow, started to lose control
The more we accelerate, the more we accelerate

Can I send this kiss right to you now?
'Cause the risk belongs with you somehow
Can I return this kiss that you gave?
Already know it’s borrowed anyway
Was the risk I sent to you received?
All the words we say to be believed?
I’m already over the thrill of pursuit
Where can I take the risk I took with you?
Send this kiss to someone new?

So you're beaten up but you bounce back
It’s all part of the pull
And the story runs like a soundtrack
We repeat 'til we're full

Started slow, started late
Started strong, then we lost faith
Started slow, started to lose control
The more we accelerate, the more we accelerate


Can I send this kiss right to you now?
'Cause the risk belongs with you somehow
Can I return this kiss that you gave?
Already know it’s borrowed anyway
Was the risk I sent to you received?
All the words we say to be believed?
I’m already over the thrill of pursuit
Where can I take the risk I took with you?
Send this kiss to someone new?


So there's no way to hide
Find some daylight
There's another way to leave the Garden of Eden
And I'm inclined to try
Find some daylight
Hollow eyes
There's another way to leave the Garden of Eden
And I'm inclined to "|0.527|0.921|6|-4.572|0|0.0396|0.0287|0.0191|0.241|0.488|155.953|4|Art of Doubt

Come on, angel, come and save us
Let me see sunrise
Give me something for the one thing
We immortalized
Gaze upon you, turning into
Some desired doll
I'll be there to come and shake you
When your will dissolves

My love
Come out of the woods
Come out of the woods
Now darling
We're out of the woods
We're out of the woods

You're safe in my mind
Some antiquated tune
In my heart some ancient song
A song too blue to even use

Come on inside, it's a long ride
'80s limousine
I'll be tongue-tied, you'll be cross-eyed
On the grainy screen
With a token appreciation
Amateur cigar
Steel-plated, silver-painted
Novelty guitar
For you, well
Isn't it good and isn't it shit?
They lured us away from the beach
And onto the cruise ship

I lied, I lied
And never grew
To be made a lonely child
The seven rules you need to know
In my mind
Some antiquated tune
In my heart some ancient song
A song too blue to even use

I remember the beat and the sound of the bass
When you played all alone
Every possible dream in the head that you held
And the hands that you hold

What did you plan?
What did you anticipate?
All you demand to find
Spiraling down, falling behind
No tomorrow
When you're ahead of your time
What did you want to know?
How does it end? How does it go?

From the bottom I fled
But the stars overhead
Led me away from the ruin
I must say that I was a wreck
Hit the bottom I guess
But the words you once said
Led me away from the ruin
Second sight up ahead

I couldn't withstand
I couldn't anticipate
How low I would go
What did I miss? I didn't know
I didn't know
Now what do you anticipate?
Another catastrophe
Coming around, following me
From the bottom I fled
But the stars overhead
Led me away from the ruin
I must say that I was a wreck
Hit the bottom I guess

It's true, I'm flawed
It's all my fault
I made every mistake, paper walls break
And it's all falling through

The past, it isn't far away
It's part of all of us, it's here to stay
I'm more than able to follow through
I'm just not for everyone, I might be just for you

If it wasn't for your kindness
I think I might be dead
If it wasn't for the way you said
""Oh, stay with me instead""
No lights on the horizon
No sign of what's ahead

Picking apples, making pies
Put a little something in our lemonade

With our diamond slippers on
Do our gay ballet on ice
Bluebirds on our shoulders

You're pink, you're young, you're middle class
They say it doesn't matter
Fifteen blue shirts and womanly hands
You're shooting up the ladder

Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my god, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my god, it was a million years ago

Sometimes you get up and bake a cake or something
Sometimes you stay in bed
Sometimes you go ""la-di-da-di-da-di-da-da""
Until your eyes roll back into your head

Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my god, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my god, it was a million years ago

Ada, don't talk about reasons why you don't wanna talk
About reasons why you don't wanna talk
Now that you got everybody you consider sharp
All alone, all together, all together in the dark

Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all
Up in the air

Ada, put the sounds of your house in a song
Try to be speechless for a minute
If you think you're gonna faint, go out in the hallway
Let them all have your neck
Ada, don't stay in the lake too long
It lives alone and it barely knows you
It'll have a nervous breakdown and fall
Into a thousand pieces around you

Stand inside an empty tuxedo with grapes in my mouth
Waiting for Ada
Ada, hold onto yourself by the sleeves
I think everything counts a little more than we think
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all

And you were there, you were there

Cut their hands off believers

And you were there, you were there

And it's half speed
It's a cruel world
And it's time

And you're walking away
But where to go to?
And you're walking alone
But how to get through?
If you want to get it all
You can own what you choose
But you want to live a lie
And love what you lose

Does it come in cages? Does it come in threes?
I'm tripping on all the time, I'm tripping on high seas
Never the car ride and never the key
I've always been failing but not on my knees
And you want to believe it and you wanna conceive
There's a different suggestion I know that I'll believe
And you want to fuck this right between the knees
Get a little bit bloody, what does it have to do with me?

But I really don't want to think about those things anymore
No, I really don't want to think about those things
I really don't want to think about those things anymore
And I don't really think about those things

There's a section for babies, was it making believe?
They get you like creature's cocks, get you like creature's creeds
I've never been sailing, not unless it's the sea
A typical lazy eye staring for you and me
And you want to collect it and you want to conceive
Get it all connected with you and you and me
And I love the darkness, it's what happened to me
I was talking about stuff I cannot believe
I really don't want to think about those things anymore
I really don't want to think about those things
I really don't want to think about those things anymore
And I don't want to think about those things

Little lies and massive dreams

And they all request that you slow down

The duvets wish that they were still wet
And all the songs they wrote instead
Your ex-lover is not dead

I'm heavy, I'm by your side
Forget me 'cause I know what I need
Like a loser like me could be fine
I'm heavy, alone inside
Don't tell me what I want, what I need
Like a loser like me will be fine

Maybe I'm living in my head
Maybe I'm living to pretend
Maybe I wanna stay in bed
Far from the weight of the world
In my hands, 'cause they don't understand

Is someone telling me ""Don't get in the water""?
What havе I done?
I don't wanna get lost inside thе color under my tongue
'Cause I don't want to be in love with another
Even in another life
Can someone tell me it's alright to be covered
Underneath the covers?
But I, no, I don't need to sleep anymore

Quiero amanecer junto a ti
Nunca más verte sufrir
Vamos juntos hasta el fin

Estar contigo es puro dembow

It all comes and goes in waves
Everything looks the same
The cornfields, the cows, the flies, the coughing
The musky air that fills our rows and permeates
Even through the ash infested vents from the fires
Eating away at the barks of trees like this moment
Eating away at the last dose of happiness lingering on the dust of our bones
The other night, wrapped in crispy motel sheets
I clenched my body and pretended I was an embryo in my mother's womb
It was the only source of warmth and comfort that could sing me to sleep
But now, I see the sheep out the window on green pastures
I hope they have water
I sometimes imagine myself being reincarnated as one
And jumping over these low wire fences to freedom
I wonder how far I could make it without a human catching me
Taming me, bringing me back to their living painting
A life to look at as they wash the dishes, smeared with my mother's milk that they stole from me
It's raining, finally
And the van is slowly drifting into the other lane
Eddie is driving
Everyone else is asleep, sometimes coming up for air
Their heads poking up like groundhogs before sinking back into their holes
But it's not all dark and grim
There are moments of hope
They come to me when it's quiet
They come to me when everyone is synched in their levels of happy, which doesn't happen often, but when it does, it's nice
I wonder if we'll look back and think that these miles of cornfields, these anguished breaths, these forced smiles, these moments that were gone, the momentary calms
And the thousands of little bugs pressed against our windshield
Were all worth it
I don't know exactly where I'm supposed to be
There's a hollow thought that takes control of me

And your heart in my sweat as you're
Lighting the end of my last cigarette

Where in thunder and lightning
Men are baptized in their anger and fighting
Their deceit and lies

Holding my wrist to the bed
He was thrusting and moaning
And pressing his head to my temple
His head was a temple

She was a shark smile in a yellow van
She came around and I stole her glance
In my youth, a vampire
Evelyn shone quiet as roses sting
It came over me at a bad time
But who wouldn't ride on a moonlit line?
I had her in my eye,down the road of a dead end gleam

And she said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too

It came over her at a bad time
Riding through Winona down the dotted line
Held us gunning out
miles down the road of a dead end dream
She looked over with her part smile
Caught up in the twinkle, it could take awhile
And the money pile on the dashboard fluttering

As she said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too
Evelyn's kiss was oxygen
I leaned over to take it in
As we went howling through the edge of south Des Moines
It came over me at a bad time
She burned over the double line
And she impaled as I reached my hand for the guard rail
Ooh the guard rail
Ooh the guard rail

She said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too

Flight is a beautiful word
Flowered with consonance
That’s what I'll followed
Forever
I am a beautiful bird
Fluttered and floating
Swollen and hollowed
For heaven

Do what you want with me
Lost in your captivity
Learning capacity
For make-believing everything
Is really hanging on

Slipping away from the party
Totally vacant
Everyone gone from their bodies
You were outside kissing another
She was a friend of mine
I was surprised to discover

I wrapped my arms around her
She was a beautiful figure
There are no enemies
We’re make-believing everything
Is really hanging on
There is a castle that stands
High in the canyon
The blue knights are crying together
A child is holding my hand
She is directing, the red crystal pine with a feather

Mercury, creeping on the sea
How she wails, flails her arms and weeps
Accumulation of debris
Lips apart, flapping as a lark
For in the dark there is release

Every familiarity scarce as the great white shark

Oh, to build walls with golden gills
Spike in hand, high above the sand
To kill the sanctuary
Every mile that is owned
Only stands still by the grace of the stone

Every familiarity scares as the great white shark

You have a mythological beauty
You have the eye of someone I have seen
Outside of ordinary situations
Even outside of dreams
You lie in bed at night and watch the lines
Of headlights through your screen
There is a child inside you
Who’s trying to raise a child in me

If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way

You cut the flesh of your left thumb
Using your boyfriend’s knife
Seventeen, you took his cum
And you gave birth to your first life
You gave Andrew a family who you thought
Could love and take better care
I have an older brother I don’t know
He could be anywhere
If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way

Rented a house in Nisswa, Minnesota
Shrapnel and oil cans, rhubarb in the yard
I built a ladder out of metal pieces
Father was working hard
Standing beneath the oak tree by the front door
You were inside baking bread
Sister came out and put her arms around me
Blood gushing from my head
You held me in the backseat with a dishrag
Soaking up blood with your eye
I was just five and you were twenty-seven
Praying, “Don’t let my baby die.”

If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way
So much more to live your life
To walk the floor
To say goodnight
Do you leave your light on?
Do you leave your light on?

Burn up with the water
The floods are on the plains
The planets in rows
Who knows what they contain?
And my brain is like an orchestra
Playing on, insane
Will you love me like you loved me in the January rain?

Mom and Dad and violins
Somber country silence
The needle stopped the kicking
The clothes pins on the floor
And my heart is playing hide and seek
Wait and count to four
Will you love me like you loved me and I'll never ask for more

What did you tell me Mary
When you were there so sweet and very
Full of field and stars
You carried all of time
Oh and, heavens, when you looked at me
Your eyes were like machinery
Your hands were making artifacts in the corner of my mind
Monastery monochrome
Boom balloon machine and oh
Diamond rings and gutter bones
Marching up the mountain
With our aching planning, high and smiling
Cheap drink, dark and violent
Full of butterflies, the violent tenderness
The sweet asylum
The clay you find is fortified
We felt unfocused fade the line
The sugar rush, the constant hush
The pushing of the water gush
The marching band when April ran
May June bugs fly and
Push your gin Jacob
With the tired wiry brandy look
Here we go round, Mary
In your famous story book

We overcome the sirens
We look both left and right
And I can feel the numbness accompany my plight
And I know that someday soon I'll see you
But now you're out of sight
And you'll kiss me like you used to in the January night

He spends his time
Or maybe half of his time
Or part of the time wandering
Around the creeks and cobble stones of Hackney lanes
With a tear in his eye
As the children walk by, he's thinking of a song
And then stops to paint a picture of a frown
Walking around

Dan Treacy's smile
Leaves you trying to decide
Who's the victim, what's the crime?
No rest for the mind that's seen it all before
And I don't know where he lives
But he's a myth of a man and Texas Bob the cameraman
Is off to fix his suit before the show
Yeah, but where did he go?

To know when your time's up
You flip the glass and watch the hours quickening
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Fluorescent lights about to quit their flickering
Well, he speaks his mind, he says, ""What is crime?""

In the middle of the park
When the underground is dark
He's a poet, he's a lark
He starts thinking about a place that no one knows
And when the creeks run dry
He stays frozen in time
Strange lights in the sky start blinking
I can see the car outside but he's listening, ooh
He's listening, ooh
He's listening, ah
And he's making up his mind

I'm cut and weeping like a rubber tree
But I don't care who's left behind
Lost revelations that I'll never find

In the long hall, pipes are whispering
Blues prepared for anti-christening

Somewhere there's an honest soul
To mirror teeth where neon lures troll
And what's extinct might come alive
A purple smoke in some internal shrine

With a long sigh let the hissing in
Stones deformed by gentle kissing and
All the closed eyes start to glisten

Blank dreams of the coming fun
Distort the odds of a turnaround

So turn it on, tune it in, and stay inert

Climbing a tree with a missing limb
And not saving anyone
And now it hurts to stay at home and see flash

The mirror ball's throwing mold
And you can't get a grip if there's nothing to hold
You see the flash catch a white lily laugh and wilt
And if you must smash a glass first fill it to the hilt

Plants, as far as I know, are still
Still bending towards the light
And if we dance until the heart explodes
It will make this place ignite
And even if this hall collapses
I can stand by my pillar of hope
It's just a case of flash delirium
Here's a growing culture deep inside a corpse
Ages stuck together, takin' it to the source
Timeless desperation, pictures on a screen scream
""Hey, people, what does it mean?""

Comfort keeps us nice
So quick to donate everything (nothing arrives)
Die wolken drifting blinding smiles circling (einkreisen)
And time's tingling spines
Attaching hands to floor
The rosy-tinted flash

The hot dog's getting cold
And you'll never be as good as the Rolling Stones
Watch the birds in the airport gathering dirt
Crowd the clean magazine chick lifting up her skirt

Lines when I close my eyes and just (Why close one eye and try to)
Aim blindly at the sun (Pledge allegiance to the sun)
And hear love when the ghosts start singing
(When plastic ghosts start terrorizing everyone)
Terrorizing everyone
And geometric troops aligning
Carried up to the burial mounds with gold
It's a heavy time but your (My earthbound heart is heavy)
Your rhythm makes it light (Your heartbeat keeps things light)
And explode like a violent star keeps (With the violence forever)
Threatening the night
And even if this hall collapses
I can stand by my pillar of hope and trust
That our heads won't bust
red battleships
Forty earthlike planets
Three holes, two tits
One fork in its side
Zero tears in their eyes

Sue the spiders, sink the Welsh, stab your Facebook, sell, sell, sell
Undercooked, overdone, mass adulation not so funny

Hey, I found a whistle that hangs like a charm
And when my noose is tied I could blow it
And fall down into your arms
Fifteen centuries of dissolution and grief
To return a yellow trickster and a thief

Hey, I found a whistle that works every time
That's when the trail escapes to nowhere
And the flood erases the crime
Such conviction, to paint all the walls with the blood
Of the young and the faithful and the good

Yeah, I found a whistle as thin as a sheet
To split the dumbness of a vision
Between a sleep and asleep
Tiny axes repeatedly raising the flag
All ignored, real emotion's such a drag

Hey, I've got a pistol that's aimed at your heart
And on dark nights when the moon is right, I could show you
The head attached with a scarf
Aerophane sorceress, at home obeying the fates
When it's gone, has it gone all the way?
This time, found a whistle that works every time
Yeah, I, I found a whistle that works
Hangs like a charm 'round my neck
Found a whistle that works every time
Yeah, I found a whistle that works
Closes my mind every time
A whistle, I've got it, I've got it this time

Sleep as the goer
The bridge that watches the light speed through
And cries while the spirit stumbles
The inside missile for the protection of you

Maybe it's silent
The voice can't bear any more strain
But speaks without even knowing
And streams outside in the direction of truth

There's no reason there's no secrets to decode
If you can't save it, leave it dying on the road
Wide open arms can feel so cold
So cold, feel so cold

Balance the books, the ledges, the looms
The disappointed look on the faces that squint at the moon
Let's see it with shadows enhanced
And then vote to decide who'll advance
Silver jet plane making a turn
Exciting the brain that expects it to crash and then burn
It's not the life lesson I'd've guessed
If you're conscious you must be depressed
Or at least cynical
But someone might still eat the steaks
Even if they're tough
Spending the day, chewing at the fat
Floating away isn't rough but it's not enough

Oh Marianne, pass me the joint
The sandpaper's tan, go-getters are surfing the point
And London's a scratch on the lens
It's over before it begins
Silk 'round her neck falls down to her shoulders
The older I get, the more I suspect there's a trick
But really there's no trip at all
That doesn't result in a fall
Or a faltering

But something could spit out the bait
Even if it's real
Rolling away, missing a spoke
Close to the ground like a wheel, but it's not a joke
Holding the line, clutching the phone
Nobly wasting the night, but it isn't right
It's not right
Smelling for blood, praying for rain
Running away isn't rough, but it's not enough

The low tide is telling me when it's over
To breathe in everything exposed
And comes back to cover me with a blanket
Being here's always changing tunes


The empty sky surrounds me but I can't see at all
Wide-open arms can feel so cold
And you can sit beside me and tell me what it's worth
But I hope I die before I get sold
I hope I die before I get sold
I'd rather die before I get sold

If you find the soul that you lost
Frozen in a starry void
Take it within and hope the sight of blood
Can will signs of life to return
Back to the way that it was
Long before it made a noise
To keep on quietly reminding you
What's never created or destroyed

Wake as the swell peaks
The close-outs drowning the birds with roars
And howls scare the new unkindness
That picks and laughs at the carrion scene

Forces you see breathe can always go into hiding
And wait 'til it passes over
Or stay far gone for all eternity

So tired, soul searching
I followed sounds to a cathedral
Imagine my surprise to find
That they were produced by Brian Eno

Past the gates, quite stark
The roses trimmed and the windows dark
I see the walls through a limestone crack
Not red not blue not yellow but black
And all the spaces left for you
If the sky was synthesized, you'd probably know

He taught me many things
The wisdom of oblique stratagems
The prophet of a sapphire soul
Presented through creative freedoms
And everything I say is true
Because if I was telling lies, it'd probably show

I can tell when he's kind of smiling
But what does he know? (What does he know?)
We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
When I was stuck he'd make me memorize elaborate curses
Tinctures and formulas to ditch the chori and flip the verses
My whole foundation came unglued
When I tried to humanize by ambient light

Dipping swords in metaphors, yeah, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
Brian Eno (Brian Eno)

He promised pretty worlds and all the silence I could dream of
Brian Peter George St. John Le Baptiste de la Salle Eno

Well, all alone by the oldest stone where the shade trees grow
(What does he know?)
The creature by the water feature with the ghostly glow
(Brian Eno)
Making sure that time's preserved well, we reap what we sow
(What does he know?)
We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
Yeah, I can tell that he's doing well, yeah, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
I'm always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno
(Brian Eno)
Yeah, he dips swords in metaphors yeah, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
I'd like to see him plant a forest, because I don't know
Brian Eno
I can tell that he's trying to smile, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
I'll always be a step behind him, Brian Eno

Dead in the water, it's not a paid vacation
The sons and daughters of city officials attend demonstrations
It's hardly a sink or swim when all is well if the ticket sells

Out with a whimper, it's not a blaze of glory
You look down from your temple as people endeavor to make it a story
And chisel a marble word, but all is lost if it's never heard

But I've got someone to make reports that tell me how my money's spent
To book my stays and draw my blinds so I can't tell what's really there
And all I need's a great big congratulations

I'll keep your dreams, you pay attention for me
As strange as it seems, I'd rather dissolve than have you ignore me
The ground may be moving fast but I tied my boots to a broken mast

The difference is clear, you throw it in your cauldron
Rust and veneer, dusk and dawn, Steinways and Baldwins
You start with a simple stock of all the waste and salt to taste

But damn my﻿ luck and damn these friends that keep on combing back their smiles
I save my grace with half-assed guilt and lay down the quilt upon the lawn
Spread my arms and soak up "|0.761|0.637|7|-8.169|1|0.0268|0.439|0.0082|0.102|0.656|125.115|4|Congratulations

Up late at night all alone
Can't you see I'm trying?
Trying so hard to hold on
To the things I know

But in the evening I will have to go
What I most want is bad for me I know

Out in the dark, shaking hands
In the street, I'm drifting
Drifting away from my family
Towards my foes

My mother told me ""you'll reap what you sow""
""What you want most is bad for you, you know""

Back in my home late at night
All alone, I'm flying
Flying above all my troubles
My mind's a gull
When I am happy my heart starts to slow
What I most want is bad for me I know

Late in the morning I wake
All alone, I'm crying
Crying for all of the people
Who love me so

But when we get sad we know where to go
What we most want is bad for us we know

He had been untrue
I had learned of all his lies
I took a look in her eyes
And she caught me by surprise
I threw his shit on the floor
She rushed me out of the door
He tried to explain
I didn't do anything
Knew that he was bad
Never knew just what he had
I still don't have a line
But I'll find one soon in time
Started crying my eyes out
I drive my car and boost out
I wish we never met
I never had a regret
I've had it up to here
I can't take this any more
If she's this crazy now
There's no telling what's in store

Maybe I should start a life with someone new
And give up all my hopes for
I went down the drive
And he caught me by surprise
I took a look in her eyes
Said ""I need you in my life""
I'm in love with him
I'm in love with her

We gotta give it a chance
La, la, la, la
But I don't know

On a boat, on my sailing ship
On my own, far away from it
Give me death, but don't give me this
I'll pass if that's ok

To rave on, rave on
So rave on, rave on

In a class where you got an A
Feel your lover's lips on your favorite day
In your mother's arms when you blast away
I'll pass if that's ok
On a stage where you love to play
On your knees, look for words to say
Thank God every single day

I'm serving bars you hoping I beat the case
Ain't that a change
The Panda changed
Slowed down the pace
To learn and to bring some change
I'm sold to this
I'ts J's and codes how niggas would die for this
Excuse the dis
Only advantage here
They started early
Barely touching a younger me
Barely notice they under me
Dreams of bumble jewellery pushing me
Foolery tom boy's the with twisting Toungue

They hate when I'm knocking on
With word and song
Been holding on
It looked like I'm falling off
But kingdom come
Like coke and rum got hits but they never saw
They never saw
Just how he potent
God know I'm such a Showman
Dome in constructing Rome and
Fanning the little flame in my hood
For dudes that understood that push passion u vona
Blings and your Tlerngy Dons
Culture and when it ruptures
I pray that your pocket buldges
I'm building bridges to Fortune and Comfort
Man Im just hoping they hear us but still we living
Heat but no Scotty Pippin
Limpin but still we pushing
We'll nail it no pimple poppin
They'll keep it but then we'll rob it

Oh-oh-oh

You got to pay your way in pain
You got to pray your way in shame (Yeah, ow)

I went to the store, I was feelin' kinda hungry
But I didn't have the money and the shelves were all empty
So I went to the bank to ch-ch-ch-check my checking
The man looked at my face, said, ""We don't have a record""
Oh no, you thought we had forgotten?
The show is only gettin' started
The road is feelin' like a pothole
Sit down, stand up, head down, hands up, and

Pay your way in pain
You got to pray your way in shame (Uh-huh)

You know what I want (What do you want? What do you want?)
You know what I want (What do you want? What do you want?)
Keep the rest, baby, ah, ah
I wanna be loved
Pay, pain
Pray, shame
So I went to the park just to watch the little children
The mothers saw my heels and they said I wasn't welcome
So I, I went back home, I was feelin' kinda queasy
But all the locks were changed, my baby wouldn't see me
Oh no, you've put your finger on it
The stove is only gettin' hotter
The sun, it's gotta, gotta melt it
Stand up, sit down, hands up, break down

On the mornin' train
It's a long way back downtown
Ten missed calls
They don't know where you are

Hey, I was flyin' (Flyin', flyin', flyin')
Over the Empire State (Over, away)
Then you kissed me (Kissed me, kissed me)

Hello, on the dark side of the moon
Jane lost it, crashed her Corvette
Ran into the tide in Malibu

And we all heard the gun
But I was slow to run

(It's just the sun)
I wanna watch you watch it burn
(So watch it burn)

Saint Joni ain't no phony
Smoking Reds where Furry sang the blues
My Marilyn shot her heroin
""Hell,"" she said, ""It's better than abuse""

So who am I tryna be?
A benzo beauty queen?

Clip on the wings
Climb high to the top of a building
Does it make you an angel
Or some kind of freak

Walk straight down the aisle

My baby loves me like a saint
My baby hates when I'm away
My baby wants a baby
How can I go on?

What in the world (What in the world)
Would my baby say?
""I got your eyes and your mistakes""
You make a home (You make a home)
I run away
And the story starts again
Then I couldn't stay in bed all day
I couldn't leave like my daddy
And I wouldn't be your only baby anymore

My baby's closer than a shave
My baby's blue when I dye greys
My baby wants a baby
How can it be wrong, wrong?
But I wanna play guitar all day
Make all my meals in microwaves
Only dress up if I get paid
How can it be wrong, wrong?

What in the world, what in the world would my baby say?
""I got your eyes and your mistakes""
I wanna run, I wanna run, I wanna chase
The еnding I can't see
Then I won't have no legacy
'Causе I won't write no symphonies
Won't have no streets named after me
Won't even have your sympathy
No one will scream that song I made
Won't throw no roses on my grave
They'll just look at me and say

At the holiday party
Red wine-lipped a little early
Reminiscin' got us laughin'
And that's when I saw your face crackin'

Smiles and smoke and screens
Your Gucci purse a pharmacy
Pretend to want these things
So no one sees you not gettin'

Not gettin' what you need, need
Need, need
You can't hide from me

Are you still workin' on your screenplay
Or did those lights go out on Broadway?
Think if you can just keep spinnin'
You won't miss what you've been missin'

Pills and JUULs and speed
Your little purse a pharmacy
And hide behind these things
So no one sees you not gettin'
Not gettin' what you need, need
Need, need
You can't hide, you can't hide from me

Look over the edge, but not too far

You're not alone
Under a sky of vultures
With all that could've been
You made it home
With silver string unbroken
Ain't that the sweetest gift?

Oh, little miracle, swing low
Where there can be no compromises down low

I don't know, but I believe
We'll get another day together
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh
No, I don't know, but I believe

And I'd have said it was impossible
To find you in this life and keep you just enough

Volvevo odiarti ma invece ti amo
La violenza alla fine mi ha reso gentile
Più vicina e vicina e vicina a te

Look at you in denim and bows
I know the mode, the mode is lethal
Say you wanna show me a place
The place is here, the here is inside you
Where did you come from, you?

Pretty with the critical mass
Your body has the body power
Lying at the foot of a linden
In a navel ring inventing June
Where did you come from, you?

And what I want is
To walk beside you
Needing nothing
But the sun that's in our eyes
Paint the picture
In blood and butter
Holy water
Fire in the sky

Lеt me dive
Through your face
To thе sweetest kind of pain
Call you up
Nothing to say
No, I don't need no entertaining
When the world
Is a bed
Give me green and ribbon red
Oh, I get
Closer than your new tattoo
Look at you all mythicalogical
And Wikipediated
Look how I forget who I was

Earth went silent
London fell asleep
She dreamed of winter
Where you appeared to me
Perfect timing as new petals in November
A tender creature
A fever
Disarming, fluorescent

There you were
With your mirror
Shining the world all over me
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

I collected
Stupid ashes
So that after you'd gone
I could hold onto something
But you stayed unwavering
Through every false goodbye
Unsubsiding
Pining
For now and for never
There you were
With your mirror
Shining the world all over me
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

Oh, if only
The umbrella of the sky
Could wrap us up and up
That's where I'd zoom in close
Dilated as your eyes
Until then, I'll keep it brief

Faithful inertia
Her bullet doesn't slow
It seeks and finds me
How far it goes
Heaven help me
Take this bag of wings
And drown it in the Thames
And wake tomorrow
Hollow
Hardly forgetting

There I was

Plane became shards of glass
And ash when it crashed on arrival I woke up
Feeling like I'm sipping on some René Descartes
And you're Big Gulping the Bible
Your wings are broken so we fly in a spiral
All I have is my love of love
But now you wanna blow us up
You're so rock 'n' roll suicidal

Tailspin, nose down
Now it's a race to the bottom
Tailspin, nose down
Now it's a race to the bottom

In a wild death spiral
(We're hitting the ground)
In a fiery pile
(Whose fault I couldn't fly)
For the dials, only by the eye
(Now the ring is on fire)
Now it's final
Death spiral
What can we say? It's too late
We can't rewind to when we were both open and amazed
Like a wide-eyed child's smile
But it's the end, we're enemies, not friends
I don't know your state of mind, mine's good, bye

This isn't 'bout the time you chased me down the street
Face a rictus of misery and pain
You grabbed my arm and wouldn't let me leave
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!
Or how I never learned to let you breathe
Condescended relentlessly
These threads need disentangling
So we have thread left to weave

Now our helix is widening, coming unbound

I thought the sun rose in your eyes
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
I thought the sun rose in
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
I thought the sun rose in your eyes

The first time ever I saw your face, laid my eyes on you
Was the Bowery Ballroom stage, you were shredding Marshall tubes
And I knew that I had to get to know
You, why don't you pack your clothes?
Move to Brooklyn on your own
And join the band, come on the road

We talked for like two minutes
But I had a feeling
Something awkward but new between us
Something strong and appealing

And we both had girl- and boyfriends blowing us up SMS
But we both knew a mood like this so strong would be wrong to suppress
Felt like it bore the impress of destiny
In a minivan in New England, our eyes met
We said yes and we said yes
Love will burn out
Love will just fade away

First time I ever kissed your mouth, we both felt time stop
My heart, it leapt up, wow, jumped from a mountaintop
Then I knew: maybe I could be with you
Do the things that lovers do
Slightly domesticate the truth
And write you ""Stillness Is the Move""

The ceilings that we ignored
The slept-on floors never ending
Our feeling obscured but pure
And our love ascending

This is how we saw the world, side by side from the road and the stage
So our lives were twined and curled and mixed up like the code we obeyed
And that was basically my dream and I dreamed it with you 'til we betrayed it

And love will burn out
And love will just fade away
And love's gonna rot
And love will just dissipate
Now we're going our separate ways
But we're still connected
You'll go forward and I'll stay the same
And that's how it breaks

Wash it away, wash it away
All of the pain, all of the pain and anger
It slips away, love slips away
But it will remain, it will remain unanswered

Now I'm listening to Kanye on the Taconic Parkway, riding fast
And you're out in Echo Park, blasting 2Pac, drinking a fifth for my ass
I'm just up in Hudson bored and destructive knowing that nothing lasts

'Cause love will burn out
And love will just fade away
Yeah love's gonna rot
And love will just dissipate
'Cause love will burn out
And love will just fade away
And love's gonna rot
And love will just "|0.677|0.733|10|-6.99|1|0.0755|0.382|0.0275|0.142|0.691|124.02|4|Dirty Projectors

How good
We could have it if we work together
I feel love should be enough to get it easily done
Maybe love is competition that makes us raise the bar
We better ourselves
We could be so good if we work together

Work together, work together, work together
Work together, work together, work together

Crippling fear, assailing doubt
So she blinkers her vision
Is the life she's living not the one she dreamt of and envisioned?

Morning
About the break of day
Here we lay, arm in arm
And cradled by the dawn

Morning
Rays of light like champagne
Filter through and fill our room
We wake with no alarm

How did you sleep?
What did you dream of?
Can you still remember?
Was it the key of love?
The line of light that we both know?
Or a shadow descending from above?

We had our own little bubble
For a while
We had our own little bubble
For a while
We didn't know one way or other
For a while
We had our own little bubble
For a while
Morning
There's no one else here
I'm alone and the cold October light hits like a black hole
Growling gray pit
Sentry of emptiness

It's not enough, whatever I dreamed of
Dreams are dumb and meaningless
Like the days they refract
Blurred and dull, empty and sad
I want to sleep with no dreams
I want to be dead

We had our own little bubble

Watching the green leaves turn brown again

As much as I'd like to say I'm grateful for the experience
That we've grown together and bettered each other
And built the city with one another
The truth is you'd sell out the waterfront for condos and malls
I'd throw the dice with the rest of 'em
Down on Broad Street and Wall

In losing you, I lost myself

You're alone
Even though you're the same
As everyone
With your ketchup blood and your changeable flame
I go out for a walk
Back way through the fog to the moon with who I talk
I am so myself, I am no one else
You are one who helped me and took my help
I fly fluid and remade
Ascending through the clouds and joining the constellation
There was never more than now
Urge and urge again, newly took and new endowed
I am not contained
In my chest or in my brain
I am energy unconstrained
And even though I want to
I find it hard to stay
In constant contact
Sometimes I go away
Sometimes I go away
Solitude becomes alienation
And leads you to togetherness
Pleasure slides into pain
And into pleasure again
Forgiveness, need, apology
Redemption and surrendering
Strangers become friends
And then strangers again
I become you and you become me
Suddenly we are not who we were
Passion and intellect combine
In human love:
Highest common denomination
The feeling of weariness
The slide in between pain and bliss
The surrender to forgiveness
The happy acceptance of a kiss
Inevitability
Of sadness
The river washing us away
Washing the garbage too and trash
Love and gratitude for the
Opportunity
One more chance maybe
To see the sun raise

Even though I want to
I find it hard to stay in constant contact
I gotta go my own "|0.445|0.397|9|-10.501|0|0.0782|0.306|0.00293|0.145|0.193|120.02|4|Dirty Projectors

How do you feel?
Is it loneliness?
Is there shining in your heart
But no gloss on your lips?
Do you sail alone 'round the island with
A silhouette of a shark beneath the skiff
And then you say

Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
Wanna be where you are
Cool your heart
Wanna be where you are
You're the right one
The right one, the right one

You've been waiting for the love in me
And there's been waters indeed
We've been hanging tight for all the things we want out of love
So wade, go deep on these mellow waters too

Heavy, hard, and far -- how we fell
And we overwhelmed ourselves with fighting and yelling
Losing and finding dreams we've held

And now we are on earth

Gratitude, you know me and I know you

And it's gonna get better (you let go my heart)
And we could just be in kindness and peace now seeing that the love is the art

And now it is gettin' late

And in its place I see you
I see you

We won't be afraid to grow
What we gave, we will always retain
I remember and I will remain
Proud and glad you were in my life

Gratitude, you know me and I know you
Time passes away
There'll be other lovers
Forward and into a
Future imagined by neither of us

Cool
One, two, one, two, three, four

Electric waves, a rush of energy
Silent river pouring backward eternally
Through the phase and touch of entropy
Old age in the beginner
To hit the stage and blush wild, laughingly
Crush the rage and rush time tappingly
Call the name so much so vapidly
Dissolving into thin air
Turning the two-fork taped-up television
Into tunnel vision
Taking the new fork tactile as revision
Working the revision

Time escaping
Time escaping

There is no reason to go down alonе
Through distortion's secret telеphone
Separate contact separate
Poison in the ether
Swinging still incessant pendulum
Lavender, nettle, calendula
Separate, contact, concentrate
Drawing out the fever
Time escaping
Time escaping

Ether
Time
It's music
It's music, Oso

Only the winter wind survives
After the heat rush feeds and thrives
After the bushfire burns and dies
Frozen and bitter
Desert ground so cold and clean
Spreading out like a magazine
Reading the dirt like gossip
What do the weeds say? They say
""Everything, everything, everything falls through
Each dimension breaks in two
Like the two hands clapping
Like the two wings flapping
Everything, everything, everything for free
As it all eventually
Turns to dust and petal
Molten rock and meadow""

From way up there, it looks so small
From way down here, it looks so small
One peculiar organism aren't we all together?
Everybody steps on ants
Everybody eats the plants
Everybody knows to dance, even with just one finger

What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take
To free the celestial body?

When I took another look
The past was not a history book
That was just some linear perception
Ash to ask and dust to dusk
A dime a dozen, aren't we just?
But a dozen dimes will buy a crust of garlic bread
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take
To free the celestial body?

When I say celestial
I mean extraterrestrial
I mean accepting the alien you've rejected in your own heart
When I say heart, I mean finish
The last one there is a potato knish
Baking too long in the sun of Spud Infinity
When I say infinity, I mean now
Kiss the one you are right now
Kiss your body up and down, other than your elbows
'Cause as for your elbows, they're on their own
Wandering like a rolling stone
Rubbing up against the edges of experience

What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take
To free the celestial body?

Name on the line, last request
Pull the car over to find some rest
Saying, ""I love you""
Need to lie here, need to leave
Living in the debt of make-believe
Saying I owe you
Crooked as a crow gnawing on dawn
Shadow from the grass in the dirt on the lawn
Why do I string you along?

My certainty is wild, weaving
For you, I am a child, believing
You lay beside me sleeping on a plane
In the future

Sit on the phone, watch TV
Romance, action, mystery
Wanted to show you
Sine wave is a particle ride
Bring your light out, then in on the tide
Maybe I love you
Maybe I love you is a river so high
Maybe I love you is a river so low
I love you, still don't know

It's a little bit magic
Like a river of morning geese
In the new warm mountain
Where the stone face forms and speaks

I believe in you
Even when you need to
Recoil

When the topsoil
Is kicking up into the storm
And the dust goes dancing
And a billion planets are born

I believe in you
Even when you need to
Recoil

Just like that
The moon goes flat
Big lights in the city shine
Crying out
Take me to the limits of your love

There's a dragon in thе phone line
Coughing up a mighty flame
With a tonguе of silver, silver
Calling out my oldest name

She says, ""Hey, you
Do you remember me too?""
We were coiling

It's a little bit magic
Magic

Wrapped in the wings of a sparrow
Beak is as sharp as an arrow
Sings in a whispering whistle
Sleeps in the ivy and thistle
Owls out swooping and howling
Deep in the midnight a-prowling
Mama, the scream of the eagle
Threading my heart through the needle
Threading the blood through the apple
Sucking the juice from the apple
Eating the seeds of the apple
Bearing the tree of the apple
Trapped in the weeds like a scarecrow
Stuck to the wind like Velcro
Distantly hearing the bell toll
Warbling chime through the meadow

Mama, the scream of the eagle
Threading my heart through the needle
Threading the blood through the apple
Eve sucked the juice from the apple
Nakedly running, I saw her
Boy chasing after to stall her
I wish I'd have spoken to call her
Before she found fabric to shawl her
Breasts bound and burdened with fiber
Adam came trembling beside her
And he said, and he said
That she has the poison inside her
She talks to snakes and they guide her

How you say when you say what you do
When your feeling is a little gold and blue
When your feeling is a little strung out
Everything we talk about
Living in the city is a crowded place
I still lose sight of every other face

Turn in your direction
Feeling like I need attention
I told you this once or twice
Won't you hear?
I see you in the yard drinking a beer
Leaving me undressed
Like some cheap classic movie
Maybe I'm a little obsessed
Maybe you do use me

One step behind you
Following you down
I was inside of you
Kissing your mouth
You were inside of me

Yeah

Came to light on a very hot day
The grass was sweating
You were sleeping in
With the window open
The blanket breathing
Cigarette on a golden ashtray
Your golden hair lay
In the swollen sunray
The withered roses hanging in the doorway

Don't wanna be let down
Don't wanna fight
Don't wanna pretend

Second sight and the clouds above you
As the wilderness grew thickеr and the crow flew
Tossing and turning, your forehеad burning

Flies on the ceiling now

Help me unearth the map and show you

Mirror in the sky making me cry again
Roll up the sheets, suddenly frozen
Like a knife carving through my thick skin

Holding mine 'til you feel ready

The big hand moving past the last thing
I turn for you, turn for you
Turn for you, turn for you

I am the private room, the quiet croon
The grey eye blinking on the new moon
I burn for you, burn for you
Burn for you, burn for you

Within the last kiss, I am the genesis
While the earth rolls, bleeding from its axis
Return to you, turn to you
Turn to you, turn to you

I am the water rise, the waterfall
Filling up your eyes and when you give the call
I run for you, run for you
Run for you, run for you
Run for you, run for you
Run for you
I am the sweaty sheets, the wet bed
The things she'll do and the things she said
I'll come for you, come for you
Come for you, come for you

I am the right brain, the paper crane
The bright gold moving past the night train
A blurred view, blurred view
Blurred view, blurred view

I am the new disease
I am the new disease, the light breeze
The yellow stars glowing through the white trees
I pine for you, pine for you
Shine for you, pine for you

I am the teeth sharp, the lips read
What is unfeared and what is unfed

Feed for you, feed for you

Red moon rising like a fire in me
So many questions, she asks them all to me
I have to answer most curiously
Scarlet angel, I am too small to see
Earn, earn, shuffle 'round the big city
Burning the rubber down, crossing the hot concrete
I'm gonna leave town, there is someone to meet
She turns her head around a full three-sixty
Woo

Bedroom rising from an old growth tree
Bringing out the sawmill, cutting the twelve-inch beams
Building a pattern, the reservoir to fill with dreams
Rings like Saturn telling their old story
Windmills turn and turn eternally
What do you yearn for? Where do you long to be?
I've been here before, looking at the wild country
Open the screen door, talking with Diane Lee
That's my grandma

Radio singing from the corner of the kitchen
I got the oven on, I got the onions wishing
They hadn't made me cry, filling the sink with dishes
Letting them air dry, waiting for the wind's permission
Too many movies got me shivering and shy
Turning the lights out, glistening in the owl's eye
Glimmer like lightning under the violet sky
Shimmer like diamonds, watching the red moon rise

Exit on a whim
Hopefully, we find it again
I'm tired of turning back
Let's keep on moving down the track
And if the horse lies down
There's a push just a mile uptown
If the horse lies down

Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride

Hand upon my skin
Warm me up and calm me down
I like to watch your chin
Tracing the familiar sound
Of a famous song
Put one on, let's sing along
To the famous song

Wake mе up to drive, wake me up to drivе
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride

The same ideas from everyone
We never plan ahead
We take the gamble on instead
And if they turn us down
Find a warm bed in the next town
If they turn us down

I could never build the ether or the grass overgrown
I could never build the river with a mouth full of foam
I could never build the winter with her cold tears of glitter
I've been listening to the red oak and the acorn she cries
Been listening to the white birch and the paper she dries
I've been listening to the frogs joke, listening to the fire smoke

I can never tеll you now what I had often said before
Bеcause promise is a pendulum just swinging at the door
And I'm not saying I'm not jealous or scared anymore
I'm just saying

I could never build a rainbow or any kind of flower
I could never make a sparrow or a meteor shower
I could never build an earthworm, never make the earth turn
I've been listening to the laughing of the fox down the trail
I've been clasping to the listening of the moss to the snail
Ooh
The shimmer of the beech leaves as the wind does a big sneeze

I could never tell you now what I had often said before
Because promise is a pendulum just swinging at the door
And I'm not saying I'm not jealous or scared anymore
I'm just saying
I could never build the shadow between your cheek and your eye
I could never make a freckle or the warm breath you sigh
The canopy of lashes with the softness of ashes
I've been listening to the memory, the way that it was
Listening to the echo of whys and because
Listening to the echo telling me to let go

I could never tell you now what I had often said before
Because promise is a pendulum just hanging at the door
And I'm not saying I'm not jealous or scared anymore
I'm just saying

Even the memory of your mouth tries to disappear
Little lights turn into spheres
Blue mountain in the rearview

Some nights, barely breathing at all

This morning, I'd heard
Somebody said they saw you 'round 1st and 23rd
Blue feathers in your hairdo

Maple cherry leaves start to fall

I tried to tell you
I didn't know how to stay
You believe she can see through
Cutting at the silent clay
A relief, beckon deep blue
Fettered in the magnet sun
Eat the gun as it feeds you
Spitting up the oxygen
Once again
Once again

Once again, empty horses
Gallop through the violet door
Follow red, crooked courses
Shadows on the moonlit floor
Oh, my stars, winged creatures
Gathering in silken height
Like the last human teachers

Once again, wе must bleed new
Even as the hours shakе
Crystal blood like a dream true
A ripple in the wound and wake
You believe, I believe too
That you are the river of light
Who I love, that I cling to
In the belly of the empty night
From the thirty-first floor of the simulation swarm
With the drone of fluorescence
Flicker, fever, fill the form
With a warm gush, now I wanna touch
Like we never could before
I'd fly to you tomorrow, I'm not fighting in this war
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms
And walk you to the shore

I remember building an energy shield
In your room, like a temple
Swallows in the windless field
Very thin, with your mother
Tall as a pale green tree
Very wild, bright as winter
Rising with a prism key
And a child to deliver
Taken with the blood and vine
As the first little angel

Little Andy, soft in your newborn skin
Only one, little Andy, will you return again?
I believe we can renew
And you could be my brother
Once again, fall asleep with our backs against each other
You believe, I believe too
That you are the river of light who I love
That I sing to in the belly of the empty night
From the thirty-first floor of the simulation swarm
With the drone of fluorescence
Flicker, fever, fill the form
With a warm gush, now I wanna touch

I already died
I'm singing from the other side
Underneath love
Avoidance and pride
I look you in the face and lie
I tell you I want your love
You're the cigarette in my fist
You are so hard to resist
I can't help but breathe your love
When I'm scared to die alone
That's when I call you on the phone
I tell you that I need your love

Oh, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love

Oh, frailty and fragile words
You tell me a lot of words
You tell me all about your love
And I feel what I hear you say
I don't talk the same way
'Cause that don't feel like love
As the dog opens his eyes
As the blue crow flies
I'm going to meet my love
I already died
I'm calling from the other side
Underneath love
There's a bottle out in the sea
With a message inside from me
Saying, ""Release my love""
Release my love, my love
I'm dreaming of release, my love
Release my love, my love
Release my love
Release my love


It's a moving operation
I'm getting off at this station
I'm leaving your love
I'm scared to die alone
I call you on the phone
Watch me bleed your love

What if all the worlds in space
Would melt into one single place
And intertwine the human race
With other kinds?
The atom is an empty vase
A vehicle to know embrace
The way you feel, the way you taste
It multiplies

So much to share
So much to share

When all material scatters
And ashes amplify
The only place that matters
Is by your side

What if all the time between
The words we say and what we mean
Would roll as softly as a stream
That we could ride?
We'd ride the bend from source to mouth
I want a friend from north to south
To build that question as a house
Where we'd reside

To the question that I had to ask, she only answered, ""Why?""
Angelia took the photograph, the moment had to die
Years later, like an epitaph, we read it and we cry
This morning, I went to have a bath, the water ran dry
Clear warning, has it come at last, the time to say goodbye?
Can we make love? Can we hold fast? I really wanna try

Two-eyed lie, is it fight or fly?
I wanna be the shoelace that you tie
'Til the end, will you be my friend?
I wanna be the wrinkle in your eye
Yeah, I wanna be the vapor gets you high

Blue angel, yeah, you're in my dreams, swearing every night
And a spider just beside her, larger than a hill
And it's plain to see if she don't comfort me, the rattlesnake will

Hold me for a moment, baby
A yellow shape in the living room that you balance out
You set aside the ingredients as I'm coming to
And I slip into states as your hands slip beneath the dirty plates
I could spend tomorrow in two rows outside the city
And I could stack my boxes in apartments with your drawings on the wall
I could sit in reverie
But what I should do is hold you by the bottom of the hill
So hold me for a moment, baby
I was uptown in the coffee shop when I finally decided
You were dusting off the tablecloth in your parents' house
We're the same, we're the same

Draw a line in the sand
Like there's nothing to regret and nothing to prove
Set my sights high enough
So I see the turning tides are parting for you

Taking back an empty threat
More than you could ever know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on
To try and not forget
Hoping that you never know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on

No more time second-guessed
Like there's nothing to forget and nothing to lose
Hold my ground long enough
'Til I see the turning tides are coming from you

Taking back an empty threat
More than you could ever know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on
To try and not forget
Hoping that you never know
Take it back with no regrets

They're spilling over us, filling our insides
In the rising water, in the rising tide
They're spilling over me, filling my insides

We got a minefield of crippled affection
All for the borrowed mirror connection
That's why I'm leaving this spoken detention
I'm a romance addict so that I can confess that:

I get world sick every time I take a stand
Well, I get world sick, my love is for my man

We got a lady who's wanting to dance
Men with the maybe looking for endings

And I get world sick every time I take a stand
Yeah, I get world sick, my love is for my man


I'm sick of the self-love, losing the ""bless me""
The exit the roof of the rule of what we'll be
And all the destroyers that never wore dresses
They live for the older, well, I'll confess this:

Bruised with a motherless childish mind
To be kind in the line of design
Without a proper subject
Got all apologies, signed up to steal
Prednisone body, topic of ill
For the chill and the thrill of the kill
I see my woman calling
Because I licked a little skin like a fear in my bed
Spilt all the toxic cream of my dead
To be bled or fed in the spread
Of equal wrong talking
Spoon me like a stereotype, rigging the race
Believing in a feather, particular face

Make the waters part into an empty heart

Is there something to coax
The truth of the day?

Defeat deflector, defeat deflector
The rushes will not lie, I swear this is your guy
And the starlet is a harlot, she does not leave the trailer
She thinks that you're a jailer or someone that delayed her

But since I have your attention
I'll just give you what you want
And maybe I'll be in your trailer

Canyon connector, purist protector
All the fun fell through, we can't escape the gloom
And the starlet is a harlot, she will not leave the trailer
She says that you betrayed her with a surfer from Australia

And in a little while another way

Move on through my wake

Looks like you wanna be

I see you've got another one almost done
Bet you think that you wished twice
I see you standing over there, underwear
The milk is going to bring you a fight

A brand new breakthrough device

Heard about your almost-kin touching skin
And leaving pictures out of the book
I thought that all the should've beens might've hid
Beneath all that they took
Never said I was the man who held the tan
And breathed while we violently shook

Up all that we could

But buildings have another tease, try to please
Leaving all the press pulled apart
Oh, I feel you like an evil wind, sucka twin
Dying for the ""never"" of stop
What, you going to seal this with all that's missed?
Oh, I think you're pulling my heart

I don't speak the tongues of finds within a life, dying for a save

I got buried with my tribe from the start, romance to the grave

Starting over won't be easy, broken divided
Split tomorrow from today
Knowing what you know just makes it harder to think straight
Starting over after it breaks

Starting over when the story's got an astounding twist
You better turn that page
When push it comes to shove we do not fall out of love
We double down, we do not fade

For all I know
This might be my last night
That's how it goes, there's no one

Crying on the line, tower under vine
Caution on repeat with nowhere to be
Surface on the peak, try a layer deep
Ready to redeem all the drudgery
Follow my pain for a long time dying
I'm crying on the line, tower under vine
Follow my pain for a long time dying
I'm crushing on repeat through another week
Toeing the line, attention to find a gate free
Pushing up to speed, cut a layer deep
Toeing the line, a tension to find a gate free
Ready to redeem all the drudgery
Drive it away and my strength might save me

It feels like eternity
For what feels like eternity
And what might overpower me
Head down, don't look up
I grind along
Feels like eternity
For what feels like eternity
To race for what's in front of me
Head down, don't look up
I sing
Shelter from the storm, keep each other warm
Who will cover me in my hour of need?
Follow my pain for a long time dying
I'm crushing on repeat through another week
Holding the light, attempting to fight the bad dream
Ready to redeem all the drudgery
Drive it away when the time lapse strikes me

It feels like eternity
For what feels like eternity
And what might overpower me
Head down, don't look up
I grind along
Feels like eternity
For what feels like eternity
To race for what's in front of me

Listen, it's hard to say
Consequence tied my tongue
Life wasn't made for one
Icons will rise and tank
Pennies in jars of clay
Heaviest fragile beast
Further ahead than me

I've got so far to go
So give my soul some peace
Suffer what it means
On some other plane
Wisdom left me blind
With nothing I could teach
The substance of my mind
The gates of shame and spite
Open to me

Over the side toss coins
Parisian fountain street
Wishes and lies compete
Moss on a rolling stone
A rising star in chains
Colder than bars of gold
Hoping the ropes will hold
Why not just let go?
The stakes are not my own
On Formentera beach
Why not walk away?
Take a sober stroll
And free my childhood dream
Before my hour is up
Time stamp my release
Today it's over

Out under bright silver skies, I accept it
Quick skip to the end, let you go
Still single frames from our life
Stream before my eyes
Like a distant slideshow

How were we to know

Split apart at the end

Seats on the last flight
Sunsets and moonlight
How were we to know?

Combined with commitment so vast
It confounds everyone

Oh please, don't attempt to placate me
Or decide in advance how the chorus should go
Pure fear is a common theme throughline
Most don't even hope to approach the threshold
An old soul cries like a baby
I still willfully ignorant live
I paint the walls in slim shady
Hell stalls forever whatever it is
It got bad, it got so bad lately
Wildfires underperform centerfolds
To inflate exaggerate greatly
Stoke fear to drive the directionless home

I thought this was just what everyone did
I thought this was just how everyone lived
I thought this was just what everyone did
I thought this was just how everyone lived

Oh please, don't attempt to placate me
Tall Hallmark phrases that roll off the tongue
Reframe a regrettable outcome
Stimulate a forgettable doll when you're done
They're all teeth the cowardly bite me
Imitation, the worst kind of flattery
Kids in cold blood on the bullet train take me
I can kill with my eyes and I'm murdering
I thought this was just what everyone did
I thought this was just how everyone lived
I thought this was just what everyone did
I thought this was just how everyone lived

Off that axis, got here solo

Paths in the sky, paths in the sky
That's you and me, and we'll always be
Half hitting highs, half flying blind
Till death divides, that's you and I

In your ragged coat one boring night
You dragged me out to cure the blues
That seemed to be destroying me
Said, ""Tell me all your brutal news""

At the back of the bar in the basement
By candlelight I couldn't hide
Those battles I could once survive
Now seemed to be destroying me
You shook your head, laughed when I said
""What a waste of an education""

Time flying on a path
Moving through thе sky
I don't ever want to land
Flying on a path
Moving through the sky
Thеre's no way to stop the time
Flying on a path
Moving through the sky
Play along and make it last
Flying on a path
Moving through the sky
So without you now, where would I be?
So many trials and fantasies
When I was broke you covered me
Our actions speak in a heavenly
Substitute for a conversation

Time flying on a path
Moving through the sky
I don't ever want to land
Flying on a path
Moving through the sky
There's no way to stop the time
Flying on a path
Moving through the sky
But we're doing what we can
Flying on a path
Know we're flying blind

Paths in the sky, paths in the sky
Till death divides, that's you and I
Till the stars mutate
Till a meteor hits your apartment
Sparks radiate your veins
Wearing sequined gloves
I saw the vase in the space, two faces
Took me a lifetime of contemplation
Time flying on a path
Moving through the sky
I wish I could stop the time
Flying on a path
Moving through the sky
Tried to sneak out through the back
Flying on a path
Moving through the sky
Play along and make it last
Flying on a path
Know we're flying blind
There's no way to stop the time
Flying on a path
Know we're flying blind"|0.549|0.798|10|-6.621|1|0.0385|0.115|0.216|0.101|0.172|123.992|4|Formentera

Get half the way civilized, take a turn
Run naked through the hallways
Free your mind, people change
Start to lie like fur beside the fireplace
Soft and light, honest hands
Hard to say how I got here in the first place
Tell the wives we're running late

I took a detour up, a detour up
It wasn't in my plans but nothing was
I took a detour up, a detour up
The map was in the hands of none of us
I took a detour up, a detour up
It wasn't in my plans, nothing was
I took a detour up, a detour up
I don't know where I am, do all I can

Take the rough terrain by candlelight
Purple haze, bedroom eyes
Spiral like a staircase endlessly
What's the use asking why
Leave mystery alone, don't analyze
Chalk it up to lust for life
Dropped to the deepest strange unfamiliar place
But i can't imagine going any other way

I took a detour up, a detour up
It wasn't in my plans but nothing was
I took a detour up, a detour up
The map was in the hands of none of us

Seems at the time, it will be just the once
And even I used to be innocent once
I couldn't wait, get us out of this place
Before once becomes once in a while

Soon it's a race, it's a rush and a high
Steal an embrace, it starts with one little lie
Try once again to redefine now and then
Before once becomes once in a while

Said it would be just the once
Said it would bе just the once
Said it would be just for fun
Said it would bе just for fun
Just the once

Once you arrive, there's only so far to fall
Ask how you got here, it gets hard to recall
Head for the door, it pulls you back in once more
Baby, once becomes once in a while

Said it would be just the once
Said it would be just the once
Said it would be just for fun
Said it would be just for fun
Just the once
Said it would be
Once
Once
Once
Though we trace the outline clearly
Of morality and honesty
We observe the outline rarely
And eventually, unknowingly
We erase the outline

What happens when the ground beneath disappears?
What once were days will feel like thousands of years
But who's to say it isn't better this way
Look at me, now I'm free, you'll survive

Said it would be just the once

Dulled our senses numb

Of a steady drum
Will grow ever near

Ranting rapid-fire

Come of age ever so late
Planning my quiet escape
Trying to disappear
One day at a time
Leaving no sign
Putting off getting in line
Putting off knowing my place
Coming off ever so crazed

Driving my willpower

And sometimes I'd serve you coffee too

Summon some willpower to weather the walk
Don't run, suffer the three flights up
Some folks still willing to pay five bucks
Don't die in the meantime, love
Tone deaf dumb comment set the whole chain off
Insane levels of a violent mob
Shared it, clicking the bait, but i won't
Don't get it contaminated love

Hot not hot summer day but i'm cold
I'm coming down with the rain
I'm through with finding some other way
Every night in my room
Who's the product, me or you ?
Small opinions, commentators of what?
Puffed up, scroll the finance page by thumb
Take us for suckers, we suck it up
But not forever the beginnings come

The storm is not the wave
The heat is not the sun
The voice is not the call
The world behind a wall
The hands are not the touch
The eyes are not the view
The voice is not the call
The world behind a wall
The world behind a wall
The world behind a wall

Then step out from behind the wall of the world
If you feel so bad, take a look from the outside

I lie awake with a stomach ache
And the first man drowns
In the last man's tears
How many rounds of monogamy
Find me listing the glut of believers
I myself played the lottery
Blame myself in the cold with a fever
How much guilt can you tolerate
Count myself among liars and cheaters
Roughed up riding a tidal wave
Time is up for your favorite deceivers
Life or death hangs in instant change
Ripping the gun from the hands of the shooter

Seconds away from the end coming soonеr
Saving the day when I'm seconds away from thе end

No, I don't get mad retroactively
And I don't get caught in the spokes of the wheel
Kick back on the sidelines a better place
Damn sure I don't ask how they pack that arena
I once set foot out where no one would
I should pat myself on the back in the morning
But I lie awake with a stomach ache
Stuck in my ways and afraid of conforming
Stuck in my ways and afraid of conforming
Stuck in my ways and afraid of conforming

I was floating on by with the morning on high
Like a girl in a song from the 70s
Every mirrored sunglass said hello as I passed
Not a thing in the world that should worry me
Suddenly

The sky is falling, oh
The sky is falling, oh
I wish this all was a lie
The sky is falling, oh
The sky is falling, oh
It’s not the wolf that will cry, cry
Go ahead and cry, cry
Go ahead and cry

I was floating along fine
What could go wrong?
I’m used to the solitude anyway
I was crisp and chill as a hundred dollar bill
Treat an overcast day like an overdue holiday
Call my mom, bake a cake, smoke a bong
Cook hot nice hash like it’s

Losing my mind
Losing my mind
I wish this all was a lie
The sky is falling, oh
The sky is falling, oh
It’s not the wolf that will cry, cry, cry
Go ahead and cry, cry
For everything we did
As we stalled and rushed

Fall asleep to the sound of your old rotating fan
I cut the fuck out of myself and soaked the bed sheets with blood again

I hold my head underwater just to drown out the noise
It's always my fault, girls will be bitches and boys will be boys
I know I don’t need you, but I'm terrified of letting you go
Even after all the times you fucked the shit out of me while I was crying ""No""

And how am I supposed to feel good about myself when everything I do is wrong?
When I’m just an ugly bitch, a fucking freak, and I don’t wanna go on?
And I don’t wanna leave my house 'cause I know everybody’s staring at me now
""Why the hell am I alive?"" is what they think, they wanna take me down

And I can’t get out, can’t run away, there’s no escaping you now
(There's no escaping you now)
I’m gonna die all alone next to you in this piece of shit town
And we’ve been cursed since the start, Jesus didn’t want us, no
And you take all of your sins out on my body like everyone else does
Shooting up our old school when we get bored of shooting up
And fuck the cops, and fuck God, and fuck this town for ruining us

And I don’t wanna talk about love anymore
'Cause it’s getting too much for me
All I do is waste and decline, waiting for that age of my life
When I'm old and love is all that I’ll need
Swaying in the lamplight in my mother’s white gown
Holding out like a dog they’ve yet to put down
I whore out my tears and just keep wasting the best of my years
Like a beauty queen with eyes bleared

Got what I wanted but it’s never enough for me
Darling, don’t you see
I’m so beautiful and it’s wasted on me?
Because the taste reminds me
I hate what love’s turned out to be

I don’t wanna be in my house anymore
'Cause it just makes me sad
Letting in the wild with every man who brings a world of hurt
With him each time he falls in my bed
Do you just want my blood?
Am I just that damn hard to love?
'Cause it feels like all I have is still just not enough
I guess that I'll just go outside
And watch the fire and fields of gold fly farther away from me
Got what I wanted but it’s never enough for me
Darling, don’t you see
I’m so beautiful and it’s wasted on me?
Because the taste reminds me
I hate what love’s turned out to be

But one of these days, it’ll come right back
I’ll get over myself and I’ll tell myself that
I don’t have to wait to be happy when I’m old
And that one of these days, I'll find a way
To fight the waves, embrace the pain
And paint the ages a hundred shades of gold
And of gold
And of gold
And of gold

Got what I wanted but it’s never enough for me
Darling, don’t you see
I’m so beautiful and it’s wasted on me?
Because the taste reminds me
I hate what love’s turned out to be

And I have found a way, I found a way
I’m on my way, I’m on my way

Wipe it up, you're capable of putting back a few when you have to
Re-memorize the history of your body, like a virgin
Ladies' night, '80s night
The kids get high and eat TV
So do we
For Halloween, I want to be Lenny Bruce

I want them to hate me
(I want them to hate me)
I want them to hate me
(I want them to hate me)
I want them to hate me
So you can love me on the sly

My old flame broke thebar blues just to prove he could
He pays the airline DJs now
He is everywhere

I want him to hate me

I want him to hate me
(I want him to hate me)
I want him to hate me
So you can love me on the sly
I want him to hate me
(I want him to hate me)
I want him to hate me
I don't feel so far away from you lately
Love me on the sly

Fill me in on horrible
How much is there?
Where else can I live?
The dirty sugar factory on the water
(On the water)
Should smell sweet

I want them to hate me
I want them to hate me
I don't feel so far away from you lately

I want them to hate me

Sort of wonder why
No one said a word
Don't you like it on the sly?
Don't you like it 'til it hurts?
Have I been on your mind?
What's a voice without a song?
Something in your head
You've been fighting all along

I don't want to say it
The news is not so good
We'll never get away
And even if we could
We'd just play the tambourine
Around an open flame
Oversleep and burn
To be back in the game

'Cause summer never comes
Nowhere near high noon
And winter never comes
Nor the harvest moon

I pay to call home
Save that date
High rise grave

I don't want to die living in a high rise grave
I pay to call home

High rise grave

No, I'm not complaining
Yes, it could be worse
Ferment on the wishbone
Match the lips to the purse
Neighborhood's a runway
Fry the ass and thighs
Dirty denim dealers
Pushed behind the eyers

And summer never comes
Nowhere near high noon
And winter never comes
Nor the harvest moon
Raw sugar
I don't want to die living in a high rise grave
I pay to call home
Save that date
High rise grave
Raw sugar
I don't want to die living in a high rise grave
I pay to call home

Still, I wear the red dress
Paint my toes and twirl
Take it back to old times
When I was still a girl
'Cause now, I'm all baboon boys
Coochie coochie coo
Sort of wonder why
I missed a kiss for you

'Cause summer never comes
Winter never comes

Piss-poor, riding high
Sunbathing fireside
We're here for the porn and the sirloin
Get your T-bone
Let your backbone slide
Tunnel and sky collide
Lose friends to the airwaves and the airlines

I'll be up too late
Call me when you get
Better at your game

The waitress
The actress
Got the skin and the bones
With a hairbrush and an air brush
She'd be white gold
She asked the piss-poor, ""Why you looking for that party in the sky?
It's just a movie about a movie, too old to die.""
But I'm gonna make it right

There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin

Four, five, six, seven

I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't, and I can't come down
I can watch but not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone

X will mark the place

Like a house falling in the sea

He said, I been where I liked
I slept with who I like
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice

And wrote it down in neat

Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis

Strangled, beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

Say you stayed at home, alone with the flu
Find out from friends, that wasn't true
Go out at night with your headphones on, again
And walk through the Manhattan valleys of the dead

Didn't wanna be your ghost
Didn't wanna be anyone's ghost
Didn't wanna be your ghost
Didn't wanna be anyone's ghost

But I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else

You said I came close as anyone's come
To live underwater for more than a month
You said it was night inside my heart, it was
You said it should tear a kid apart, it does

Didn't wanna be anyone's ghost

Little faith, follow me
I set a fire in a blackberry field
Make us laugh, or nothing will
I set a fire just to see what it kills

Now I'm stuck in New York, and the rain's coming down
I don't feel like we'll go anywhere
Stuck in New York, and the rain's coming down
Still in line for the Vanity Fair

Leave our red Southern souls
Head for the coast
Leave our red Southern souls
Everything goes

All our lonely kicks are getting harder to find
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody cries
All our lonely kicks, they'll make us saintly and thin
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody wins

Awesome prince, get your sleep
Lose your heart in history
Make us laugh or nothing will
I set a fire just to see what it kills
Don't be bitter, Anna, I know how you think
You're waiting for Radio City to sink
You'll find commiseration in everyone's eyes
The storm will suck the pretty girls into the sky

All our lonely kicks are getting harder to find

So happy I was invited
Gave me a reason to get out of the city
See you inside watching swarms on TV
Livin' and dyin' in New York, it means nothing to me
I gave my heart to the army
The only sentimental thing I could think of
With cousins in colors and somewhere overseas
But it'll take a better war to kill a college man like me

I'm too tired to drive anywhere
Anyway right now, do you care if I stay?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find somethin' on this thing that means nothin' enough

Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

This pricey stuff makes me dizzy
I guess I've always been a delicate man
It takes me a day to remember a day
I didn't mean to let it get so far out of hand
I was a comfortable kid
But I don't think about it much anymore
Lay me on the table, put flowers in my mouth
And we can say that we invented a summer lovin' torture party

I remember everything seemed less heavy
Disorienting, think I'm running on empty
We've got gravity and that's not a lie
Got regretfulness of days gone by
There are times where I feel I'm regressing

Looking back to then, I feel so bad

Can you stay with me a moment?

Can we live this way?
Can you stay with me a moment?

I'm not trying to make you feel any pressure
But things are moving fast and that's not a lie
If you're not growing, then they say you'll die
Pretty soon, think we could sail to the moon now
Oh, just think of looking down at the blue how
We could be there when the gravity dies
Hold my hand and watch the days go by

Can we live this way?
Can you stay with me a moment?
We've only got a moment
Going to stay
Can we live this way?
Can you stay with me a moment?

And I will do my best to keep my focus
To give you my everything
And if this mess is unfixably broken
I can't think who I'd wanna see
Someone like you standing with me
In the end

Survival by the soundtrack made of our short lives
Making sense of hologram ecology
I'll be up crying listening to Grace
And hiding in the pages adding up to me
Eternity

The ball that broke your tooth
And carving at me all the time was I had done you wrong

Certain times in our lives come to take up more space than others
And time's gonna take it's time

It was the evening when he climbed that tree
I was afraid what he was doing inside so I followed him to stop a robbery

Io mi addormentavo insieme alla coscienza sporca
Stanotte torneranno un'altra volta
Io rovesciavo scope come scudi messe di fronte alla porta
Portavo sempre a letto un ansiolitico di scorta
Stavolta sarà l'ultima dicevo, forse non le vedo
Verso un altro distillato e bevo che quasi ci annego
Prego un Cristo che non mi ha salvato mai davvero
Nell'eretico racconto rosso fuoco Tardo Medioevo
Rito blasfemo tipo sabba dentro la mia tana
Sanguina la lama nella trama tipo Mario Bava
Giocano a spogliarsi e poi sorridono e piangono lava
Nessuna mi ama, sputano frasi a punta cava
Contano la fava e non provano pena
Calderoni di porzioni per la cena
Si spegne la candela e muore in volo pure l'ultima falena
Mi accarezzano la schiena nella luce di una luna piena

E le streghe ballano una danza per i maghi
Con un filtro magico per spaventare i draghi
Gira gira il mestolo, tira su il coperchio
Gira gira il mestolo
Tra gatti neri, gufi ed ossa di caribù
Mi entrano in casa mentre dormo e tornano su
Ma qui le notti delle streghe non passano più (No)
Non è un déjà vu (No), non passano più
Tagliano i cieli come ali di marabù
Ridono in bilico sui tetti e vengono giù
Ma qui le notti delle streghe non passano più (No)
Non è un déjà vu (No), non passano più (No)

Strisciano sul pavimento freddo e salgono sul letto
Praticano un culto neopagano, rito maledetto
Tagliano queste lenzuola viola con unghie e falcetto
E scrivono il mio nome sullo specchio col loro rossetto
Grammi di sale fuori dalla porta e sulle scale
Per non farle entrare, il mio portone diventa un portale
Le sento gridare sui lampioni spenti del mio viale
Mentre il mio quartiere si sta trasformando in Salem
Lingue sconosciute da Aramaico che cambiano voce
Bambole decapitate appese a un albero di noce
Teste che si incastrano nel ferro di un forcone a foce
Destino atroce, butta la croce
Abbraccia il male spirituale come il grande caprone di Goya
Corpi dati in pasto a corvi in fila sulla mangiatoia
Tagliami la lingua con una cesoia e tirerò le cuoia
Tanto so che torneranno anche solo per noia
E le streghe ballano una danza per i maghi
Con un filtro magico per spaventare i draghi
Gira gira il mestolo, tira su il coperchio
Gira gira il mestolo

Tra gatti neri, gufi ed ossa di caribù
Mi entrano in casa mentre dormo e tornano su
Ma qui le notti delle streghe non passano più (no)
Non è un déjà vu (No), non passano più
Tagliano i cieli come ali di marabù
Ridono in bilico sui tetti e vengono giù
Ma qui le notti delle streghe non passano più (no)
Non è un déjà vu (No), non passano più (no)

Bevo dal matraccio l'ultima razione di veleno
Fuori si fa giorno ed il paesaggio è di nuovo sereno
Levitavo pallido ad un metro e mezzo dal terreno
E proprio ora che se ne vanno io non posso farne a meno
Mi mancheranno come gli occhi di chi non capiva
Che quest'amore è una promessa senza aspettativa
Lingua di crotalo che bacia, brucia la saliva
Il buio ci assaliva, tornava ma non veniva
Tra gatti neri, gufi ed ossa di caribù
Mi entrano in casa mentre dormo e tornano su
Ma qui le notti delle streghe non passano più (No)
Non è un déjà vu (No), non passano più
Tagliano i cieli come ali di marabù
Ridono in bilico sui tetti e vengono giù

Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose

Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes 'round and 'round
The beat goes 'round and 'round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance

You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, and you look back
Not just once, and not just twice
Wish away your nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You got the light, you can feel it on your back
A light, you can feel it on your back

When I'm at the pearly gates
This'll be on my videotape, my videotape
When Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me
This is one for the good days

His window’s already passed
So he’s shooting at the glass
Keeping guns in his locker
And he denies it
Like it’s actually important
But he lied 'cause I sure did watch him
Showing up wearing black
And he knows that
His daddy’s on death row
But he’ll say it with his chest, though
His friends move dope
He hasn’t tried coke
But he’s always had a problem saying no
His older brother bagged the valedictorian
His mother steady screaming he should be more like him

Hard odds to bеat when you’re on all fours
Good men die too so I’d rather be with you
I owe you a black eye and two kisses
Tell me when you wanna come and get em
I only want him if he says it first to me
I wanna … him in the back of his mom’s Mercury
He looks like he works with his hands
And smells like Marlboro reds
It makes me so … and I can’t get enough of it

Sacrificial angel, dirty slut with needs
In a convocation or a room alone
Call me what you want and I'll be that
Sucking on his teeth, he needs it so bad
He's screaming ""Party's over, go the fuck home""

The darker the fruit, the sweeter
I ask him if he's ok with that
He's mean, I'm meaner
My baby says that he's not afraid of that
I say ""You're right, in a way""
Giving it up on top of him
He says, ""How so, babe?""
He wants to know how

Pissing on the stove to put it out
Watching him through holes in his door
Sucking on the back of his leg to stay warm

""Doo doo doo doo...""
“He's a landscape.”
“He's like a ruby lined in gold.”
“Yeah, shaped like a cockroach.”
""He smells good.”

Ordinary, a bit lazy
I was swinging on a branch outside, catching a ride when my resolve swelled
I will find him, I will
I have momentum still

I saw him a friend, a friend
I found in him a friend, a friend

Nonetheless, he would escape
But, it was for the best

The sky has darkened, earth turned to hell
Some said a light got shined where darkness dwelt
So I won't cry or collapse, overwhelmed
Time like a song just might rhyme with itself

I don't know how I'm going to be a better man
I don't know how I'm going to reach the Promised Land
I don't know how I'm going to get you to take my hand
But I'm going to try and I know when

Right now, now (now)

Soon the earth may dissolve like snow
We'll meet again in the air all bound to glow
And I am glad that I got to know
I might sing the melody
But I don't set the tempo
Who draws the true straw from the fist that's clasped?
Who pulls the new rope through the loopholes of the past?
Better hurry up for the first shall be the last
Better sound the trumpet before the blast

Neo real cheekbone
She is so dreamy
Like she's got features on Fellini
Deadpan, unimpressed

Just hanging out all Julian Casablancas

Her electricity opens my days like she always knew
I feel an affinity, immediately
In all the ways, she's a break-thru

But she keeps itin the shade
She's a break-thru

That's nothing new
But she keeps itthrough the shade

She is so wow

Her line is Pablo but her color's Fauve
So what about it?

She will a-break thru
Nobody stops her
No one can lock her down

Who will stop wasting the lives of the brave
Based on a lie?
Who will stop wasting the forest and seas?
We know what will survive
Who will stop wasting the time?
Who will stop putting quarters upon on our eyes?
Who will not place himself higher than we
For a senator's prize?

We wander out wild-eyed
Kinda drunk and kinda high
We know what for and why
That's a product, that's a brand, that's a lifestyle

'Cause the monster eats its young
Till they're gone, gone, gone
And the rules are there to hurt
And that's the way it's done
Yeah, the monster eats its young
Till they're gone, gone, gone
Till it's satisfied and done
It wants blood, blood, blood
Who could look up from the numbers and say
""Something ain't right""?
Who could disrupt the abundance and pray
Not for weight but for light?
How could we risk the empire
As the apprentice descends into seasons of Idol
When our old, white Lincoln encrypted and high
Sputters down from the sky
Red-eyed in July, weeping glycol?

We shout out loud, megaphone
Kinda zoned but listening in
We browse our own episodes
That's a product, that's a brand, that's a lifestyle

When the predator dips out from the haze
Who knows the price?
When the words mercy and justice are raised
Members only apply
When will we count all the signs?
When will we finally not let fear weaponize?
When will the courage to breathe and let breathe
Assure the land will survive?

Garden of flowers all bloom
When they're watered right
Laughter echoes in the room but it dies outside
Are we fundamentally alone in the universe?
What would it possibly mean if we found in each other

Something unexplained (and the feel remains lingering)
Strange lights (in the summer night sky)
Something opening (an auspicious beginning)
From the time when my eyes saw the design

I feel energy
Could this be just a tender dream?
I feel energy, yeah
I breathe, you breathe, we
I, I, I, I feel energy
I feel energy

Sometimes I get so depressed (depressed)
And I just can't move
Don't cry, they make you feel like you're dead (dead)
And it's never going to improve
But then something unexplained (and the feel remains lingering)
Perfume (in the midsummer night)
Something opening (a new consciousness beginning)
In the room when my eyes saw the design

Crazy to feel like this
Up and down, simultaneous
Victory and defeat
One to one, we'll have to wait and see
And now the clouds are gathered
My eyes are bright, my khakis tattered

The stakes are raised
The townspeople are anxious and alert
The surface of the reservoir is mirrored and inert
The flag is hanging motionless on the pole outside the court
And in their homes the people look with stares they can't avert

Zombie conqueror
We see into the midnight in front of us
Zombie conqueror
We see into the midnight in front of us
My friend, we'll have to free each other more than once
Zombie conqueror
We see into the midnight in front of us
Night, night
I left home at fifteen
I knew no home between
Half a life goes by
Only a picture of the sky
And now the clouds are gathered
My eyes are bright, my khakis tattered

The blocking characters all plotting new disloyalty
But sensing their irrelevance, they're frowning and displeased
The car chase through the mini-mall, amaryllis on the hood
The race to clear the courthouse has been won and all is good

Sky is blue, the sun shines everywhere
Breeze is blowing, messing up your hair
The Palace Versailles is nice
But if I am honest
I feel just fine on this bench with

You and me
Me and you
Something sweet
Something new
Fresh and clean
Like the beginning
Blue bird, sing your tune
From the lilacs in bloom

Walk around the city in the light
Talk about whatever's in our minds
I admit some surprise and delight
Fascinated by you
I feel lucky to get time with

You and me

Ask now, I'm in love for the first time ever
The universe becomes my mom and my dad
A hand in a glove on a joint adventure
Moving toward our own Goldilocks planet
'Cause when everyone latched like Auto-Tune
Into the grid that they all just assumed
Was and was not a map of the universe
They just misplaced the pure wave that is you

I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you

Everybody wants the same chimera
Everyone hungry but honey get off the feeds
Salt of the sea and the salt of Sierras
I preach to birds and then bees preach back to me
Now in hindsight the alienation
And all the painful dreams I failed to extinguish
Were the footlights down dark aisles I've taken
Now they've led me to you and I'm singing
I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you
I found it in you
I found

And when we met there were alien hosannas
Thrown from the heavens like Prince and Nirvana
Like braided brooks tied tides woven oceans
Like the trees interleaved with explosions
Of birdsong as they're singing to me
Down to earth in the land of the free
In the new time that you've given to me

I found it in you
I found it in you

Leave the spoon-fed champions
Leave the lamplit prose
Leave the endlessly distracting madness
And say hello
Hello
Hello

What is the time when I can call you by your name?
I don't know why it's been so long
Alone, imagining nobody
Once in a while, well
I guess the planets align
And show me the one I am
I am the one who would love you

Seek the dusty longshot
On the last frontier
Join the minor miracle that looks flat
But reveals itself a sphere
As the wheel of inception steers

What is the time when I can call you by your name?
I don't know why it's been so long
Alone, imagining nobody
Once in a while, well

And show me the one I am
I am the one who would love you
They say it's ashes to ashes
Passion is passing
And we all will die alone (Wow)
But while we're here on the planet
Dancing on granite
Why don't we drink Côtes du Rhône (Wow)?

In all my life, I remember the people

A wheel is in motion and spins til it's spun
'Til the earth absorbs us, laughing in flowers of sun
I choose to be yours because you're the one

Oh, high thanks I owe you, excellent
Lover and beautiful friends
Through all the memories I have been
Hoping for you to come make my world new again

Are you ready to work out?

Don't take it the wrong way

Maybe I'm out to lunch
But I'm constantly swiping and tapping
It's never relaxing, I need a new routine

Breathing in the dark, lying on its side
The ruins of the day painted with a scar
And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try
The feelings start to rot one wink at a time

Oh-oh
Forgiving who you are for what you stand to gain
Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded
Horrified with each stone
On the stage, my little dark age

Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
The carvings on the fetish say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
The humor's not the same, coming from denial

Oh-oh
I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing
All alone, open-eyed

I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
You know that if it hides, it doesn't go away
If I get out of bed, you'll see me standing
All alone, horrified
On the stage, my little dark age

Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come
The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind

Policemen swear to God, love's seeping from the guns
I know my friends and I would probably turn and run
If you get out of bed, come find us heading
For the bridge, bring a stone
All the rage, my little dark age

I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing
All alone, open-eyed
Burn the page, my little dark age

On my phone

Time spent sitting all alone, time spent looking at my phone
Time spent sitting all alone, time spent looking at my phone
I try to pull the curtains back, turn you off but can't detach
When all I want and all I know is time spent looking at my phone
(On my phone)

Find me when the lights go down, signing in and signing out
Gods descend to take me home and find me staring at my phone
I'm wondering where the hours went as I'm losing consciousness
My sullen face is all aglow, time spent looking at my phone

Last thing that you need is the new shiny feature
All the memories you've shared, devoured by perverted creatures
Nothing can compete with the first time you saw her
Passing strangers on the street, spending every moment looking at their phones
(On my phone)

Time spent sitting all alone, time spent looking at my phone
Time spent sitting all alone, time spent looking at my phone
I call you, you don't call me back, almost had a heart attack
I'm listening to the window moan, time spent looking at my phone
Clouds are getting full, so you close all the windows
I would never let you die, even if our love is ornamental
You know what you need is a way to remember
You can never find the time if you spend everyday looking at your phone


You should come with me, we can lose ourselves in nothing
Copy faces from the feed and then try to turn them into something
Even if you choose to believe that it's ending
You'll come back to me again, you can go ahead and stop pretending

One thing left to try, see if you can make it
Before you choose the night and the silence overtakes you
If you looked into the fire and you had that conversation
Then there's one thing left to try if you want to save your life

Fear is his name, but his friends still call him God
Again and again, the thought remains

(The only way to get rid of the feeling)

I don't wanna die, wishing I'd done something
More than what's required to last until the sunset
No, I don't wanna die, thinking that I'm dreaming
There's one thing left to try if you want to change your life

Today I left those thoughts behind, behind
Over and over, you die just to feel alive

The only way to get rid of the feeling, you have to draw the line
And remember there's more than you're seeing, decide
Do you want to keep us alive?
Do you want to feel alive?
Do you want to keep us alive?
Do you want to feel alive?
(Fun is over tonight) Do you want to keep us alive?

You put your belly up to the bar
Squint your eyes, you can almost miss the dirt
You tell yourself, it couldn't hurt

But when you're small
You can't walk down the hall

You're not very big at all

When you're low, you reach a certain point
Where you can't really see the point
You can try, but you can't see eye to eye
Yet when you're low then you really know

But when you're high
It's easier to fight
When you're high

The deals we made to shake things up
And the rights that they abused
Might just fuck us over
But the doors won't shut until they're sure
There's nothing left to use
Someone's taking over
Threw it away, but now I say
It's time to hand it over

The joke's worn thin, the king stepped in
Now we'll see who is who
Look who's bending over
But the stars weren't wrong, the time felt right
We both knew it was true
The smart ones exit early
And the rest hope for a shoulder

Ooh-ooh, wahoo
Ooh-ooh, wahoo
Ooh-ooh, wahoo

If everyone's confused

And then you wanna get out
When you get the money
To buy yourself a castle
How will you wear your leisure?
Your zipper back and front
On the fence together
Weekends in leather
Flip to the right
Slip back to the left
For handshakes at the ranch
Small talk at the crossroads
Rubbing up to the ladder
Sucking on every rung
Coming up forever and hanging on

That's entertainment
When the cameras roll
Can you face the pavement
For a happy dog and pony show?
Everybody loves you, baby

On the day we were supposed to leave
You changed your mind at the station
You had a nice apartment
There was a good bar downstairs
Your old friend worked there
I'll go anyway, I'll go anyway
They won't refund the ticket
Well, it's a good story

But I don't wanna live it alone
Crash to take a chance
I wanna live it out
I know I'm already dead
No concrete adversity
Only traps of our own actions
How we wanted it to be
Now, I'm never gonna see you again
You turned off
Vertebrae by vertebrae
Roll your way out of a coma
Look up, the nurse is smiling
What luck, the nurse is me
Your old body is dead
Your body's dead, you're a word instead
In my sleep, I repeat it
Well, it's a good story

But I don't wanna live it alone
Crash to take a chance
We were gonna live it out
Look at you, you're already dead
How will you remember me?
Digging ditches out of boredom
Said you could never leave
Now, you're never gonna be here again

I put the groceries down on the front lawn
And think maybe the children just want recognition
I wrote the fairytale on a midnight drive
Wanting to know if I'm more than alive
I torched the fields again
And killed an honest man
Now I understand Mother Nature
Watch me running head-first into the thorns
It's like the lights are off but somebody's home

Unwrap that tourniquet 'round the sun
Turn those subtle reds into neon
You'll see the difference when it's done
But I undеrstand your hesitation

Come take a walk with mе down billionaire's row
Trying to keep our balance over zero
We'll write the fairytale for the rest of our lives
Throwing the trash away one more time

Holding on to love like a stone
Melting down today for tomorrow's
Covenant of the heart
You know it's turbulent from the start
And I understand it's not your nature
But you need a friend
To take you home
You've got to begin again

To open castle gates and let me go inside
And taste the bitter tea that won't let you hide
Then we can take away as much as we can steal
Break all the precious bones before the guards appear
Before the fantasy is cast into the fire
And strike the temple bell to resonate the—

Covenant of the heart
You know what comes right after the dark

Life keeps on going
Showing you things that you can't unsee
In the sense of unknowing why
Anything happens to be
And just as the sun comes out again
Something is blocking the light
But it's alright

The inside's still glowing
Telling the heart what it wants to hear
But what if it's only lies
Twisted apart by fear?

Well, that's when the brain waves goodbye
From the front of the train where the coal is burned
And you know the refrain without hearing a sound
So you sing it again 'cause you won't

Learn from the people in the streets

Wheels left the ground
Hoping to fly past the road ahеad
Components start breaking down
And sooner or latеr, you're dead
And just when the wool goes over the eyes
Somebody moves you along
But it's all wrong
And someone complained that the fire was out
So they shut off the rain and let the flames return
Now they had to rename all the tricks in the book
And I'm starting to doubt where I once stood

And there's people in the streets
There's people in the streets
People in the streets
There's people in the streets


End of the line
In real time
I stopped clinging to what's mine

They're marching to the beat of a different drum
Going over receipts with a magnifier
The people in the streets aren't singing along
'Cause they're probably sick and they're probably tired
I listen for the sound of the starting gun
But when you're living the dream and your ears are bad
The people in the streets aren't part of the fun
And I'd go and join them, but I'm so
Scared of the people in the streets

Bubblegum dog
Tell me what the truth is
Isn't this bed a log?
Doesn't that confuse things?
Shouldn't I run?
Isn't that the white man?
None of this seems like fun
But maybe that's the point, man?

For years I've strung you along
Afraid of the bubblegum dog
And it's finally catching up with me
I hope it's a false alarm
But the pain of the bubblegum dog
It's finally catching up with me
Who would have believe? I saw

Tenement homes
Built upon a fault line
Juvenile quetzal birds
Living in the coal mine
Manicured lawns
Tibetan straw men
Igneous basketballs
Drifting through the heavens
I felt hate toward the earthly world
But hate is a very strong word
And it's finally catching up with me
The years of plodding on
In fear of the bubblegum dog
It's finally catching up with me

So I'll pray it won't be long
I'll wake up and it's all gone
You and me
We'll keep it calm
My bubblegum dog


The shame of vitriol
Aimed at the bubblegum dog
It's finally catching up with me
And I hate this bubblegum world
But hate is a very strong word
And it's finally catching up with me

So we'll hide until it's gone
Boil the ones that don't belong
Pay the man to keep it on
Days are short and nights are long
Bang our heads against the gong
Maybe tinkle on the lawn
One for all and all for one

This is what the gods must have been talking about
When they told me, ""Nothing changes""
Falling through the Pleiades straight into a cloud
Wishing all the stars could save me

And I feel strange, like I shouldn't be here
Let me know if you receive me
If I could change, then I wouldn't be here
Oh, nothing's gonna change, believe me
So don't lead me on

This is what the birds must have been squawking about
Right before the dream was ending
And maybe you'd have heard if you'd stopped fucking around
When it was time to stop pretending

That I could change and I wouldn't be here
Oh, when did all the gods deceive me?
I should change, I shouldn't be here
But nothing's gonna change, believe me
Believe me

Thrust the dagger into the night, valiant flailing
Sisyphean daily life, with endless straining
Fortify the curtain walls, but nothing's storming
Push the boulder off to the side

Half of love is still love
You beg the dawn to ease you in
Pass the time a thousand ways
In the dump, you'll find love
Half the time, I feel sad
And any kind of love will do
But it’s a job, don't know if that's the dream
In a style that’s insincere

For a six-dollar coffee
And municipal parking
And Disney on Ice
I wish I was joking
I wish I was joking

I wish I was joking (I wish I was joking)
I wish I was joking (I wish I was joking)
I wish I was joking (I wish I was joking)

Here's the thing about drugs
They'll sink your mind and steal your friends
You kiss the sky below the bed
You get in the car, but don't go
I'm kinda into being home
It's the time for love affairs
'Cause now and then, I can't tell right from wrong
You talk me down, you raise thе dead
Nobody calls me ""the gangstеr of love"" (Gangster of love)
At six in the morning
A new day is dawning
I wish I was joking

I wish I was joking (I wish I was joking)
I wish I was joking (I wish I was joking)
I wish I was joking (I wish I was joking)
I wish I was joking (I wish I was joking)
I wish I was joking (I wish I was joking)

You can sail off the edges of the earth
Greet the workers of the universe
Still nothing prepares you for loss of life
(Mm)

At the table, undressing cosmic knots
What remains of disconnected dots
Who knows how the painting will look in the morning
When the day is born and life is ending (Ah)

But it's neither created nor destroyed
There's a way to quiet all the noise
'Cause it's only a different kind of gain
Even if your color fades away


When thе world is born and life is ending
Then you lеarn to love your loss of life (Ah)
When the morning comes and life is over (Ah)

I'm writing to ask you, did you achieve all you wanted to do?
Before we were dragged up, something was different and nothing was new
How did you see me? We didn't know what we wanted to be
When did we move on? I didn't feel it, nobody told me

Time to kill
Was always an illusion
Time stood still
And now we never will, never will

We wrote our names along the bathroom walls
Graffitiing our hearts across the stalls
I've been waiting for my whole life to grow old
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will

Standing in streetlights, we didn't know wrong, didn't know right
Making a mess and running in circles, getting in fights
We were just kids then, we didn't know how and didn't know when
Taking our chances, calling it off and starting again

Saying that we're never free

Hiding inside my dreams
Fighting inside my head
Scaring myself to death
We live in a wonderland
Like blood isn't on our hands
When will it be enough?

When will I say I knew we had to get away
Knew we had to get away
Knew we had to get away from the storm?

Can't live forever with my head in the clouds
Can't predict the weather with my feet on the ground
You tell me that we'll be alright, but I don't know if you're right
I can't live forever with my head and my heart in the clouds

I am counting every sheep
But these rabbit holes run deep
Trying to be so right
Desperate to start a fight
All of this pointless talk
Why can't I turn it off?
When will it all just stop?
When will I say I knew we had to get away
Knew we had to get away
Knew we had to get away all along?

Ooh, already it was dark outside
Tables set with china dishes
We're welcomed in with tiny kisses
What's her name?; I don't remember
Isn't that the famous author?
Harry's gonna get some appetizers
Well, he's keeping out of range of small arms fire
Dina has a phone; she says it's working
Now she's crawling on the floor, across the kitchen

Something I should tell you
But we are never alone

Tanks outside the bedroom window
We'll be okay with the curtain closed
The guests are fine behind the sofa
It's much too late, they should not go home

Something I should tell you
But we are never alone
Up by dawn, already morning
I ask myself what is going on
Some tender words and sidelong glances
Are you okay, have you lived here long?


Underneath the stairway
Somebody's changing her clothes
Sweatpants and a t-shirt
Silk dresses cover the floor

Sit down by my side
Take my overcoat
When will we get out?
Maybe a week or soon
Some of us losing it
Some of us breaking down
Some of us stick it out
Used to it now

Something I should tell you
But we are never alone
There's something I should tell you
And I've been waiting so long

When it's over with, going our separate ways

In a garden stands a statue
Of the man who won the war
His expression, tender yearning
Ev'ry nation near and far

Oh sad and ancient father
Sweet as honey, tough as leather
Running down the hill on Christmas Day

I am an ape, I stand and wait
A masterpiece, a hairy beast
I move so fast, I take a chance
Then come up close
I'm not a ghost

Navigator, when you wake up
And you step outside your door
Shoes and panties washed and folded
Taking off your dirty clothes

This garden tells a story
Amber close-up, faded glory
Running through the streets on Christmas Day
I am an ape, I stand and wait
A masterpiece, a hairy beast
Try not to laugh, just take a chance
I visited
Inside your head


If you trespass in this garden
To a place you should not go
If you step out from the shadows
See the city fall in awe

I am an ape, I stand and wait
A masterpiece, a hairy beast
No need to hide, come on inside
I will not last
I too shall pass"|0.663|0.538|0|-8.869|1|0.0463|0.33|0.000108|0.273|0.206|110.131|4|Love This Giant

The desert at dawn
A mountain at night
And the rhythm moves on
The people awake
They're marching along
The streets are alive with a terrible song
Forward and backwards in every direction
The atoms' perpetual motion
The shifting of light
On the banks of the river
I'm free, but I'm keeping my clothes on
I'm marching along
The street where you live
I'm calling your name
The song is a gift
The song is a road
The road is a face
A face is a time
And a time is place
A place of relief in a time of confusion
A heart is a simple equation
With beautiful words and with beautiful people
A song is a face, is a mountain
A fruit that falls before it's grown
I heard a sound and a bird has flown
It breaks to pieces above the forest
A million particles born today
Out beyond the blue horizon
Air cannot escape
Underneath the weeping willow
I can see your face
Free-form calling all over me
Creatures big and small
Doctors pulling them out of you
Hideous, virtuous, both of us
Come in my kitchen
When it rains outside
Sweet inspiration
Sneaks up from behind
The forest is true
I know for a fact
That the bigger the front
Then the bigger the back
My heart beating still
Through the perilous night
The bombs burst in the air
But my hair is alright
The shifting of light on the trees and the houses
I drowned in an ocean of perfume
The strangeness of words, how the meaning keeps changing

I wrote a song called ""Just Like You and Me""
I heard the jokes from the sports reporter
The rival teams when they faced each other
The more I lost myself, the more it set me free

How are you not like me?
Everybody's in the hotel lobby
I'm blending in here, yes, I am
I feel it moving in my arms and fingers

Maybe someday understand them better

Crooked teeth
Somewhere out beyond the stars

Remember one Christmas, I gave you Jim Carroll
Intended it as a cautionary tale
You said you saw yourself inside there
Dog-eared it like a how-to manual
Remember one summer, we walked in Times Square
I showed you the zombies with hundred-inch stares
You took a Bic, set your hotel on fire
We took the blame, took the bags to the train

Happy Birthday, Johnny
Wherever you are
Happy Birthday, Johnny
Wherever you are

The last time you called it was on New Years' Eve
You asked me for dough to get somethin' to eat
Since we last spoke, you live on the street
Yeah, I wouldn't believe all the shit that you've seen

Happy New Year, Johnny
Is it twenty-three?
Happy New Year, Johnny
Are there lights on the trees?
When I said, “Let me think,” and you yelled through your teeth
Accused me of acting like all royalty
Always for show, no true charity
You saw me on magazines and TV

But if they only knew the real version of me
Only you know the secrets, the swamp, and the fear
What happened to blood? Our family?
Annie, how could you do this to me?

Of course, I blame me

It rides and sticks to my thighs and my hips
You put me in a teacher's little denim skirt
Ruler and desk so I can make it hurt

Love you to the grave and farther
Honey, I am not your martyr

You dress me in a nun's black habit
Hail Mary pass, 'cause you know I'll grab it
Hand me a badge and a little billy club
Like I'm supposed to book you on a hit-and-run

Adore you to the grave and farther

But, honey, I can't be your savior

Sometimes I sit in the smoking section
Hopin' one rogue spark will land in my direction
And when you stomp me out, I scream and I'll shout
""Let it happen, let it happen, let it happen""

And sometimes I feel like an inland ocean
Too big to be a lake, too small to be an attraction
And when you wander in and start to flail a bit
I let it happen, let it happen, let it happen

Sometimes I stand with a pistol in hand
I fire at the grass just to scare you right back
And when you won't run, I'm mad but I succumb
Let it happen, let it happen, let it happen

And sometimes I go to the edge of my roof
And I think I'll jump just to punish you
And if I should float on the taxis below
No one would notice, no one will know

And then I think
What could be better than love, than love, than love?

Sometimes the windows combine with the seams in a way
That twitches on a peak at the place where the spirit was slain
Hey, one foot leads to another, night's for sleep, blue curtains, covers
Sequins in the eyes, that's a fine time to dine
Divine who's circling, feeding the cards to the midwives
Who love those alien days
The nonstop alien days
Ooh, the alien days

Must've skipped the ship and joined the team for a ride
A couple hours to learn the controls and commandeer both my eyes
Hey! Be quick dear, times are uncertain, one month crawling, next year blurring
Decades in the drain, monograms on the brain
Decide what's working and what's moved on to the last phase
The floodgate alien days
I love those alien days
Mmm, the alien days

When the peels are down it feels like traveling in style
You don't need wings to hover forty-ton stones for a mile
And in the summer, virgin visions, mindless humming
Numbers can't decide if the day's supposed to smile
Today, find infinite ways it could be plenty worse
It's a blessing but it's also a curse

Those days taught me everything I know
How to catch a feeling and when to let it go
How all the scheming, soulless creatures
Can't find dreamer's honey in the hive
If it's right beneath the nose
And when the light is new, the sky shows trembling cartoons
You don't need smoke to cover most of the world in a gloom
But here comes racer number 7
Watch my fingers ripping out the lines
If it looks like we could lose

If it looks like we could lose

Whenever I drift by the unknown
Feign like I notice a fundamental tone
The fine petals open and close offended
Poor explanation and nothing shown

Kind of like if a friend exits without a sign
Glimmering like a precious stone
Maybe we shared a dream fornights in a row
I might feel better knowing that I was alone

Wherever scientists turn lead to birds
Torment ignites essence, delights from the earth
What you find shocking, they find amusing
Something else to soften a sadistic urge

When they tell you the extent of the vice
Then the prime time mission is to choke the statistician
And like the senses that you're lurking behind
While it gnaws right through to your core
Oh I'd twist it more

If you think that you're free (Free like a kite)
Watching as it flies by (Spy the unknown)
Focus on the quiet oars
Tell me how far you'd go (Go where you like)
Knowing your air won't last (Last one to know)
Would you feel better holding the stars up
What if the beast escapes (apes have it good)
And separates like a cloud (loud like a fault)
Seeps into the hollow bones
Wouldn't its eyes expand and zero in like a scope

It can't pay attention
What slips into the system
A light touch, a whisper that puts you to sleep
Don't sympathize with the mystery disease
All it is is a feeling
Pain in a dress too revealing
A lost bond
An old friend who likes what it sees
You can't shake off the mystery disease

Lovers in a past life
Meet in the street close to midnight
A last look
Sweet like the end of a dream
Then fall back into the mystery disease
Go on, tell your symptoms to me
It's not in any of the books you can read
It's no fun to face what you don't get to be
But what's one more to the mystery disease?

Floating impatience
Snuffs my limited sapience
Black smoke as soon as the pressure's released
Deep space sighs, the Mystery Disease
Consumed by a weakness
Cut with perpetual unrest
You see stars, sunsets blurred through a screen
Trap what you want
Waste what you need
And when the west wind sweeps through the leaves
Emperors of history fall to their knees
Small fronds can't see the wood for the trees
Left in the dust of the mystery "|0.253|0.951|4|-4.047|1|0.0872|0.0002|0.346|0.35|0.382|144.112|5|MGMT

Glowing in the shadows
Twisted in confusion
Grazing in the meadows
Voices in profusion
Colors, thoughts, emotions
Are trapped within the heart
Feeling no emotions
End without a start

Introspection, what am I really like inside?
Introspection, why have all the prophets lied?
There's a season when I will find out where I am

And hiding when it comes
Seeing its reflection

Burning for revenge

I can still hear the reflections in the air
Feeding time
Either hemisphere, if it's summer there
Seeking you, taking a dive
Streets realigned
Ooh ooh ooh
Stored in my mind

All I could do not to steal
All the fun in the world
From your little heart
And now I owe it back to you
But it's hard to catch it and let it go
Find excuses to burn right through the grief
And to melt, to melt, to melt

Oh my poor memories
Down to a trace
'Til you forget that, I'm alive
And you feel it's all right

Tune it out
And I'm sure you'll be fine

My green silken river and two lights
I could almost touch the free walls
When we were evicted from the heavens
Fast clouded-over bumbling eyes

Now peering out through a sinking
Cosmic smile, reversed completely
Flaming currents forced us to surface
Wet purple gowns and blaring alarms
All for some milky perversion
Nothing the spooks wouldn't be used to
Spoiled by an empty fear of violence
The only time I've ever been dropped

The minute the mirror turned its back to me
My distinct conviction of keeping
Eternal sources piled somewhere familiar
Was compromised and tangled in knots

For all I know we were sleeping
Arranged like Fate's vain infantry
Stacked in unconscious opposition
Blind and happy for tomorrow
For tomorrow...
For tomorrow.."|0.525|0.956|2|-5.701|1|0.0566|0.0192|0.846|0.142|0.4|138.015|4|MGMT

Who is much more than a friend
But never by my side?
All beginnings are an end
In the blackness there’s a light
Maybe you will only read
One or two letters at the most
Shipping crates might line the streets
Every stranger is a ghost

Cashiers won’t deduct the pain
Loneliness sleeps on the couch
Only noticing the stain
Once the color’s faded out
Let’s go camping in the cold
Make a fire, buy a tent
Envision leather getting old
Re-send pigeons that were sent

Try to memorize your smell
It reminds me of a field
Crickets clearer than a bell
Have all their guts recast in steel
Birds don’t cry when echoes quit
They trail off into the fog
Autumn hurts far less than sticks
Knowing winter’s five feet tall
Generations of defeat
All assuming you're the worst
They never tied the cans
To the back end of a hearse
Take your hand against my own
If there’s a finger I can grip
Reassure me at the ace
Mine’s a black heart you could flip

I’ve come to terms with what I have
What’s been given, what’s been asked
Turn my back against the sea
And beg the serpent for a dance
But in the red dirt muddy towns
Celebration of the dark
Children walking hand in hand
With the pygmies in zee park

I can’t touch you only once
You always leave me wanting more
So keep my feet within the house
And stick my toes just past the door
Let me know when I’m in love
Let me die when I’m in "|0.212|0.861|0|-5.896|1|0.0539|0.162|0.0624|0.176|0.175|151.618|4|MGMT

There's plenty of girls in the sea
And plenty of seeds in a lemon
The trick is to try to stay free
When it's never that great to begin with
The surgeon performs precise little cuts
But he's never perfect, he's thinking too much
Oh, and it's really no comfort to me
There's plenty of girls in the sea

There's plenty of girls in the sea
And plenty of those are not women
As soon as you get yourself free
Then somebody stops you from swimming
The lifeguard admits, his whistle in hand
That it isn't the muscle, and it isn't the tan
No it's whatever you want it to be
There's plenty of girls in the sea

Ah the passionate painter will say with a brush:
""It's best to accept it and not make a fuss
Oh, Just cause the grass isn't green""
Yeah, there's plenty of girls in the sea
There's plenty of girls in the sea
And plenty of clowns in the village
The trick is to try to be free
And tend to the void, don't just fill it
The bartender concedes, from inside his vest
That none of the best ones were ever the best
So keep it short, simple and sweet
Cause there's plenty of girls in the sea

Make friends, make peace with death
But most mainly wanna win the game
They came to win, they want to come out ahead
But you, you're a rock with a heart

And will you guess when I come around next?
I hope your open sign is blinking still

I'm as fickle as a paper doll
Being kicked by the wind
When I touch down again
I'll be in someone else's arms

We'll do what married people do

Send my cinders home to mother
They gave me a medal for my valor
Leaden trumpets spit the soot of power

They say, ""I'm on your side when nobody is, 'cause nobody is
Come sit right here and sleep while I slip poison in your ear.""

We have taken to the streets in open rejoice, revolting
We are dancing a black waltz, fair Paris is burning after all

I read the signs
I got all my stars aligned
My amulets, my charms
I set all my false alarms
So I'll be someone who won't be forgotten
I've got a question and you've got the answer

I do a dance to make the rain come
Smile to keep the sky from falling down, down, down, down
Collect the love that I've been given
Build a nest for us to sleep in here
You know it's real

I check my palms
The cracks in the sidewalk
My visions and my dreams
I cross all my fingers

Your tears were salty ocean
You opened up the engine and listened to it sing
And I thought you a lamb
You knew your daddy 'til you were thirteen

And the far off salty ocean
We shook our bodies and we started to scream
And I asked you again
Tell me when we grow up, do we ever go home?
You said home becomes the highway
We ordered movies on a motel screen
Until you needed me warm inside of your mouth
And my skin was salty ocean

Having a bad week?
Let me touch your cheek
I will always love you

Having your face hit
Having your lip split
By the one who loves you

Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black
Real love is a heart attack

Showing your mother to any other
Letting them touch her
Looking up to her
Watching her do her makeup and hair

Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black
Real love is a heart attack
Cry like a bird, fly like a baby
Mama got drunk and Daddy went crazy
If your speech slurs, if you feel shaky, meet me out back
I'll be there waiting

Riding in the back seat
Watching the spit fly and the hummingbird cry
Oh mama, oh papa
Oh mama, oh papa
How much blood is worth the draw?
How much blood is worth the draw?

Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black

Hummingbird watching
Watching her young thing
Grow up so fast
Looking up to her
Watching her do her makeup and hair

What's far from here is not so scary
Though you cannot see her
You don't have to worry

I was horrible and almost let him in

Shoved in the kitchen of a city tomb
The light would flicker like a violent womb
The night was thicker than a smoky fume
And Liza waited in the room
Benny loved her like he loved no one
The way she'd laugh and hold a smoking gun
The way she always said, ""What's done is done.""
And he was not the only one

Love is a gentle thing
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring

A victim healer with a sharp sharp blade
Benny knew how she was getting paid
Her water broke and they would have to wade
And when he knew that she was fooling
He faced the mirror to avoid the thing
We're outta money and we sold the bling
And I just wanna take you home, I just wanna take you home

Yours is thicker than a velvet ring

I swear to God
6 AM geekin', in the stu' wit' it
My bronem wit' me, hm
Shit a movie we livin', that's for real
Protect me from the fake
Been through it all, I knew I was gon' get it one day
Homicide out there, but I still went on that playscape

Product of the field
We ain't had no money, but had a loaded steel
She ain't really know his pain, she left him when it's real
See, niggas think they was gangster, they geekin' off the pills
Detectives, they be honest, they think brodie hе was on a drill
And that first nigga who died, gave him a birthday wish
Get up supеr close, I swear that glizzy kiss
Brother told me he was smiling, laughing when he seen him twitch
Got lot of killers in this mansion, girl, don't let 'em in

And I saved a hundred racks before I hit the stage
And I know a hundred rats, so I watch what I say
And she know two hundred racks ain't worth a hundred bricks
It's hard to stand around the pastor, got too many sins
Save me, brother know I'm going through it all
He gon' par with me
And if I win, you know we all win
I had the junkies calling at the same time I had the labels calling
They told me watch my back
They think that I can't watch myself
I fought for the grind, I ain't never fought for help
I woke up and went to that corner where my brother died
But I can't complain 'cause we spin back right there, many times
I'm nauseous, I'm gasping for some air
Ain't makin' racks, but still she sittin' in hotels
I can't tell you what I did 'cause niggas tell and bitches tell
Cut off the loose ends, I was lookin' for some clientele
Life on the dirty, dirty Jane, I swear my block be so famous
She ain't wanna come around, she said, ""It's too dangerous""
I said, ""My lifestyle is amazing""
I learned how to get it from the struggle, I ain't basic

It's just the fact we come from a bloody scene, it's a scary site
Don't get caught on the fences, green beam, it's on sight
And we ain't never call for no protectors
My brother know I'm there with him
Yeah, he there with me
Lot of niggas ain't gang, but say they gang, so it's , fifty
I write you everyday, ""Do you miss me?""
Look what we done, baby, we got history
Look what we done, nigga, we got history
We was loadin' G-Locks way before fifteen
Fell in love with mmm-money route, my main squeeze
Feeling safe with DP on the drill, I know he gon' squeeze
We from the sea so I'll show you how to swing a rod

Future of the human race
Hell is not the hottest place
Let it go, shed your skin
Children never sleep again

Take me as your prisoner
I want to be an alien
Take me please, oh alien
I wanna be an alien
Take me

Yo' instruments can't stop our ships
Soon you'll be our guinea pigs
The rest will all be blown to bits
Let it go, you had your day
Spaceman take your kids away

I wanna be your passenger
Take me as your prisoner

Take me please, oh alien

Your wars are of no use to us
You cannot fix what never was

Where ocean meets the shore
In the place where we could meet
You will be all alone

So as we angle to the new

Never a woman on the shore

I slipped up, felt the echo of a memory rise up and disappear from me
Fill my cup, now that I’ve had two or three, I can get a little free
It feels good, to celebrate the loss of my independence
I’m in the mood, to let the rhythm push me out of my head
(You're the one)

I’m lit up, dancing in my room alone I lock my door and turn off my phone
Fill my cup, now that I’ve had three or four, I could use a couple more
It feels good, to tune out from the wrongs of the world around me
I’m in the mood, to let the warm embrace of my cup surround me
(You're the one)

I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em

I’m fucked up, but I think I could have some more if I could get myself off the floor
Spilled my cup, the room is tipping to and fro, my mind is moving kinda slow
I know I should, break out of these walls I have built around me
If only I could, face up to the world let the truth surround me

All the lonely sole survivors of markets of the ghosts
Obsidian only where magma is exposed
Where the world is wide
With wonders worth the roam
Wild watcher in the night
Sing until you melt the stone sing

Blue in the islands
Blue in the sky
Daddy don't cry it's just a bump in the night

Black starling white violet
Don't leave the palace silent
Stream in stars and tears wands and pentacles
Let me light you like a candle
I will light you
Black starling white violet

Lonely lovers in the keyhole lonely lovers on the run
Bones in cranium shakespearean
Dedicated dedicated dedicated ones

Dark nights and blackest dreams
When nothing's ever as it seems
And you are all alone
And what's left in between
When creepers pick your stitches clean
And you are all alone

But there's one thing they can't keep
This twilight kiss from me

All night I'll run with you

Yeah all night I'll run with you
'Til black in the sky turns

Late nights and starless stones
When there's no moon to lead you home
And you are all alone
But these nights they live in me
And I have clever energy
And you are not alone
But watch them run and hide
When I light the lightning shrine

Right by the pathway to the pond
To the forest underground, I'll be around

And when she fit you like a glove

The only way I can see you
It's not enough, it's not enough
In skyways and in canyons
I've searched for my companion
On wings of love always

As violet finds its way above the moonlight shade

And dream of simple things, the silver maple tree
What dreams give back again
At night beneath the waves

The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement
Up above aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets

They're all uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it
I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away

But I'd be alright, alright
Mom, I'm alright, alright

Fitter, happier, more productive
Comfortable, not drinking too much
Regular exercise at the gym three days a week
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease
Eating well
No more microwave dinners and saturated fats
A patient, better driver
A safer car
Baby smiling in back seat
Sleeping well, no bad dreams
No paranoia
Careful to all animals
Never washing spiders down the plughole
Keep in contact with old friends
Enjoy a drink now and then
Will frequently check credit at moral bank
Hole in wall
Favors for favors
Fond, but not in love
Charity standing orders
On Sundays ring road supermarket
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Car wash, also on Sundays
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace
Slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned, but powerless
An empowered and informed member of society Pragmatism, not idealism
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet
Shot of baby strapped in back seat
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat
Tied to a stick
That's driven into
Frozen winter shit
The ability to laugh at weakness
Calm
Fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig
In a cage

Take a step back to where it started
Where it stands, where it stood
With everyone here, when nothing was wrong
Slip through the cracks, not disregarded, still disheartened
Moving on 'cause I'm here and you're still gone

You left me hanging once again just like I knew you would
It's more than I can comprehend, I'm at a loss for words
So sweet, dipped in honey, but I see
That the look in your eyes tells it, so tell me

You hold the key, soon you will see
You were the one talkin' in circles, biting your tongue
I know you better than you know yourself
Look what you've done, you play the fool
Continue to run, talkin' in circles, biting your tongue

Taken aback, it seems regardless where your heart is
Here and now, the clock still ticks, the timer runs out
Chipped but not broken, let's steal some gold and play the cards
We can win, 'cause I'm still here, I've been all along
You left me hanging once again just like I knew you would
So many things were left unsaid, I'm at a loss for words
So sweet, dipped in honey, but I see
That the look in your eyes tells it, so tell me

You hold the key, soon you will see
You were the one talkin' in circles, biting your tongue
I know you better than you know yourself
Look what you've done, you play the fool
Continuing on, talkin' in circles, biting your tongue (Circles)
Biting your tongue

Accelerate, accumulate

Wound up in a movie with no story

Hesitate outside the times
With all I don’t say
With all I don’t do
I’m sending you invitations to hesitate too

Thinks falling bombs are shooting stars sometimes
But she doesn’t make wishes on them
When she wishes, she wishes for less ways to wish for
More ways to work toward it

Our falling bombs are her shooting stars
Hesitation’s always mine

Find some models for wives
I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin
And fuck with the stars
You man the island and the cocaine
And the elegant cars

This is our decision, to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?

Evil $, I, yes, to find a shore
A beast that doesn't quiver anymore
And we could crush some plants to paint my walls
And I won't try to fight in the weekend wars
Was I? I was too lazy to bathe
Or paint or write or try to make a change
Now I can shoot a gun to kill my lunch
And I don't have to love or think too much

Instant battle plans written on the sidewalk
Mental mystics in a twisted metal car
Tried to amplify the sound of light and love

Christ is cursed of fathers and martyrs
Might even take a knife to split a hair
Or even scare the children off my lawn
Givin' us time to make the makeshift bombs
Every mess invested was a score
We couldn't use computers anymore
But it's difficult to win unless you're bored
And you might have to plan for the weekend wars

Try to break my heart, I'll drive to Arizona
It might take a hundred years to grow an arm
I'll sit and listen to the sound of sand and cold
Twisted diamond heart, I'm the weekend warrior (huh)

Whisper crimson I intrude
There's light beneath your eyes
New overtones in view, endless form, endless time

If what they say is true
You are a shadow in the fourth dimension
To float away with you
We see the corners where nothing happens

While we drifted, we were one
Ceilings lifted walls were gone
You speak the language of the breeze
All your leaves were meant for me
The love that every person wants to be

Stuck together, I don't like revealing secrets
I'll live inside your lips if you won't laugh
My heaving hands on rotten fruit at last
Fallow fingers, there's a surface I can count on
She'd fit inside my heart and take it over
'Til her cape got blown into my red lungs
Either there's a purpose
Or I'm heading out at breakfast
Take a drink, take a drag
One more coffee, ugly hat
No more mirrors, woolen bag, and I am "|0.381|0.939|9|-4.684|1|0.125|0.042|0.918|0.172|0.335|159.97|4|Oracular Spectacular

When the world has turned, paralyzed and wrong
Cold-blooded claws never offered anything at all
Past the point of love, shattered and untied
Waiting to pick up the pieces that make it all alright

But pieces of what?
Pieces of what?
Pieces of what
Doesn't matter anymore

Moonlight on my floor, shinin' through the roof
They got the city surrounded, as if I needed proof
I forgot my fear, feelings on the rise
Buried by all of the pieces fallin' from the sky

But pieces of what?

Why'd you cut holes in the face of the moon base?
Don't you know about the temperature change in the cold black shadow?
Are you mad at your walls or hoping that an
Unknown force can repair things for you?
Pardon all the time that you've thrown into your pale gray garden?
If your ship will never come, you gotta move along

Even a bird would want a taste of dirt from abyssal dark
The prick of a feather could make a kingdom burn and the bloodshed start
The falling apart
Made me a shadow in the shape of wonder the waves of black
If she's going under, I can hold my breath 'til the sky comes back
Or drown like a rat, rat, rat
He's a rat


To catch a monster, we make a movie
Set the tempo and cut and cut its brains out
It will inspire on the burning pyre
Half the distance, half the motion
Communication is easy as the ocean

I just shook the handshake, I just sealed the deal
I'll try not to let them take everything they can steal
People always told me, said, ""Don't forget your roots""
I know I can feel them underneath my leather boots

You toss all the mornings lost to the clouds
And you watch it go
Your fair weather friends on a parachute binge
Get lost when the wind blows
The handshake's stuck on the tip of my tongue
It tastes like death but it looks like fun

I was a loner, I was just waiting by myself
When you, warped temptress, rose to bring me happiness and wealth
Black tears, black smile, black credit cards and shoes
You can call all the people you want, but it's you who's being used
Under your black eyes, honey, right beneath your nose
A curse on all creation, every single thing you know
White smoke, white light, white marble on the floor
It would only take a few seconds of darkness to figure out what's in store
Little girl

You convince yourself that you want it
But you don't know

And there were future reflections
On the face and the hands
On a green-colored island
On a primitive man
It was the future reflecting
It felt familiar but new
A street was missing a building
The kids had something to do

There was a feeling the spirit was leaving
Red like a marker
So my tribe, with my knife
Cut the heart from a lonely life

I saw patterns on floorboards
Deep in the dust was a leader
Someone was walking on floorboards
Turning from oak into cedar
He can assess the situation
I wrapped a string around my finger
Into the forest with the young ones
I don't expect to be a winner
But as long as you feel it, I'm a believer
My heart is phosphor
Sea rolls and death tolls
Break the surface, don't break my bones
Off of the trail and off of your hands and
Onto a new plan
Is the cost to stay lost
Forever in an empty skin, pale and thin?

If it's good, or if it's fortune, I can't tell
But pieces come together for some reason, just as well
Their guns couldn't see us, there's a sea outside my door
And one day I'll appreciate the rush of blood and the washed-out beat of the shore

And remember what it felt like
To be alone
Sitting in the sunlight

Got something I can't hide
Still alive, it's an overwhelming drive
To prevail and get out of this jail
Dust in my eyes and a tear in my sail

Back and forth between the desert and the sea
Who I was and I will always be
Oh yeah, woo-hoo
Too bad, woo-hoo
So sad, woo-hoo

Take me out 'cause I'm all alone
Hair undone, despair unknown
Got something trapped inside
Still alive, it's a momentary ride
I've been on a thousand years too long
A thousand years too late for everything that's wrong

Back and forth between the desert and the sea
Who I was and I will always be

Oh yeah, woo-hoo
Too bad, woo-hoo
So sad, woo-hoo

Who did you say you were?
I didn't catch your name
Falling down to earth
Down from a higher plane
Oh, it's been decades
Say, what did you see?
Oh, I've been so lonely
Won't you keep me company?

Do you remember me?
We met out on the farm
By the fire, you spoke to me
And held me in your arms
The songs you played for me
I long to understand
All along the watchtower
And castles made of sand

When there was a wilderness, we wandered wild and free
Guilt, she is the governess that guides me back to grieve
What if we were dumb enough to spend eternity
Gathering the garbage washed up on the beach?
Do you remember me?
We spoke by telephone
The bad connection had a meaning of its own
Of all the good and all the stupid shit I've done
The worst was all for me
Not hurting anyone

Now, what is this?
Feeling I know you from long ago
From deep in my past
I don't know why
Why I trust you completely
Don't question it
The bottle is empty

Now, what is this?
Club closing early
The fog machines
And lasers swirling
It's Halloween
I'm sorry for screaming
But I'm afraid
I scare you completely

Now, what is this?
Blizzard in April
I'm underdressed as usual
And we're cheating death
Buying time from the winter
It's house arrest
No stopping for dinner
Now, what is this?
Microphone working
Can't hear myself
But cameras are rolling
And there's the cue
My heart, it beats so hard
I look for you and suddenly fall

Now, what is this?
Robin you rescued
Its broken wing
Not broken long
You search the room
Someone yells from the garden
The orange cat
Finished what he started

Now, what is this?
Skidding of tires
I hold my breath
And you're running fast
As the SUV
Smashes into the sidewalk
And
Won't answer the call
Now, what is this?
Hollywood ghost town
A shootout scene
No actors at all
Last night I dreamed
You and I were immortal
It's no big deal

When I care less and you care less than me
When I don't need and I don't believe in

You and I, we fall apart

It didn't used to feel this good to be all alone
Doing every damn thing I can to not go home

I give up

I give up
How far can you fall

Wrote myself a letter
Just a single question
When you finally get this
Where will you be?
Will you be a shipwreck or a star
Falling for a boy who doesn't play guitar?
Now rewind the tape back to the start
Said I'd never leave you, but here we are

And you can't look at me now
I haven't changed, I'm still the same
But you can't look at me now
A hand grenade to throw away

And it's just your kind of trick
To leave me empty-handed
Leave me with a riddle unsolved

Played by the magician

Blurry at the edges
Leaving only legend

Awake from a dream
One that started as a nightmare
Like a war so extreme
It erased itself from memory
Here's where I jumped
From the aeroplane without questioning it
The curve of the coast of Los Angeles
Spreading itself below

And blooming overhead, the parachute
I've got to trust it now, oh

Change in the wind
And I'm drifting from the crescent
Pulled farther out
From the shore than where I can swim to it

And blooming overhead, the parachute
I've got to trust it now, oh

Closing in on the sparkle of the waves
Go on, take me, it will feel like going home
Go on, take me, I'm not afraid to drown
What is this, pulling me back the other way
To strip malls, highways and treetops?

Palest pearl
Pearl of greatest price
Poured first form
It’s all you wanted

But you’re caught up in the rush
Of lust
Do you really want that much
Trust
The maze, your mind

It’s curling opaline
In the finest curve
There’s light in all design

But you’re caught up in the rush
Of lust
Do you really want that much
Trust
Does it make you want to run
The touch?
Or would you watch it turn to dust
For lust?

With downy wings
While out alone and traveling
Came wandering
The bubble king
From under rivers rippling

Through silver slivers, of colors in his cape
Her heart begins to shake

She shakes

She shakes

Oh bubble king, you’re everything
The sparking zenith of my ring
When you speak to me, in dark heart beats
The sound it leaves me trembling

I shiver lover, a quiver and a quake
And my heart begins to shake

For wildest wishes for all her prayers and visions
Of reckless hearts in rhythm

Impressions of a love
To fool the careless of the eye
For you to conjure up
So simple in your mind

Wicked and wild, haven’t you seen yourself
Loneliest isle, lost in the greenest swells

Confess it to yourself, the light the loyal oval shines
For you and no one else, a fool a million miles

Wicked and wild, haven’t you seen yourself
Lonliest isle, lost in the greenest swells
Wicked and wild, haven’t you seen yourself
Lonliest isle, lost in the greenest swells
Lonliest isle, lost in the greenest swells
Fooled with a smile, haven’t you had enough?

These crosses all over my body
Remind me of who I used to be
And Christ forgive these bones I'm hiding
From no one successfully

Jesus can always reject his father
But he cannot escape his mother's blood
He'll scream and try to wash it off of his fingers
But he'll never escape what he's made up of

The fates already fucked me sideways
Swinging by my neck from the family tree
He'll laugh and say, ""You know I raised you bеtter than this""
Then leavе me hanging so they all can laugh at me"|0.256|0.574|4|-9.383|1|0.0437|0.109|0.052|0.136|0.0889|104.737|4|Preacher’s Daughter

Grew up under yellow light on the street
Putting too much faith in the make-believe
And another high school football team
The neighbor's brother came home in a box
But he wanted to go, so maybe it was his fault
Another red heart taken by the American dream

And I feel it there
In the middle of the night
When the lights go out
And I'm all alone again

Say what you want, but say it like you mean it
With your fists for once, a long cold war
With your kids at the front
Just give it one more day, then you'rе done, done
I do what I want, crying in the blеachers
And I said it was fun
I don't need anything from anyone
It's just not my year
But I'm all good out here

Sunday morning
Hands over my knees in a room full of faces
I'm sorry if I sound off, but I was probably wasted (Probably wasted)
And didn't feel so good (Didn't feel so good)
Head full of whiskey but I always deliver
Jesus, if you're listening let me handle my liquor
And Jesus, if you're there
Why do I feel alone in this room with you?
And I feel it there
In the middle of the night
When the lights go out
But I'm still standing here

Say what you want, but say it like you mean it

Labored breaths and bed sores
Sing it to me all day long
When the aching sound of silence
Used to be our favorite song
You and me against the world
You were my man and I your girl
We had nothing except each other
You were my whole world
But then the day came
And you were up and gone

And I still call home that house in Nebraska
Where we found each other on a dirty mattress on the second floor
Where the world was empty
Save you and I
Where you came and I laughed, and you left, and I cried
Where you told me even if we died tonight, that I'd die yours

These dirt roads are empty
The ones we paved ourselves
Your mama calls me sometimes
To see if I'm doing well
And I lie to her
And say that I'm doing fine
When really I'd kill myself
To hold you one more time
And it hurts to miss you
But it's worse to know
That I'm the reason
You won't come home
But I still call home that house in Nebraska
Where we found each other on a dirty mattress on the second floor
(When I needed you, and I need you still)
Where the world was empty
Save you and I
Where you came and I laughed, and you left, and I cried
Where you told me even if we died tonight, that I'd die yours
(So I died there under you, every night, all night)

You know, I still wait at the edge of town
Praying straight to God that maybe you’ll come back around
I cry every day, and the bottles make it worse
'Cause you were the only one I was never scared to tell I hurt
And I found photographs of our school, on the day we met
I thought that you were so beautiful, it was love, I guess
And you might never come back home, and I may never sleep at night
But God, I just hope you're doing fine out there, I just pray that you're all right

And I feel so alone
And I feel so alone out here
I feel so alone
And I feel so alone out here
And I feel so alone without you
I'm so alone out here
I feel so alone, I feel so alone

He's never looked more beautiful
On his Harley in the parking lot
Breaking in to the ATMs
Sleeping naked when it gets too hot
I watched him show his love through shades of black and blue
Starting fights at the bar across the street like you do
The neighbors beat on the walls while I'm face-first in the bed
Show me how much I mean to you, while I'm lying in these sheets undressed

I'd hold the gun if you asked me to
But if you love me like you say you do
Would you ask me to

Trouble's always gonna find you baby
But so will I
Crying only because I'm happy
Hold me across every state line
I'm never gonna leave you baby
Even if you lose what's left of your mind
'Cause you know I'll be right there beside you
Riding through all these western nights

I haven't spoken to my daddy in a long, long time
I don't want him to worry, always wondering if I'm alright
But the neighborhood keeps getting smaller
All starved out when the money's paper thin
All that's left are your walls and you'll die there
I should have known that there's no getting in
Trouble's always gonna find you baby
But so will I
Crying only because I'm happy
Hold me across every state line
I'm never gonna leave you baby
Even if you lose what's left of your mind
'Cause you know I'll still be right behind you
Riding through all these western nights

Through these western nights
Crying in the light of the TV static
I'll still be alright
Clinging onto you like some love blind addict
I'll be screaming your name
Past the gas stations, trailing down the interstate
Please don't love how I need you
And know that one day, you and I could be "|0.423|0.324|9|-11.304|0|0.0318|0.769|0.00048|0.0942|0.0994|80.143|4|Preacher’s Daughter

Remind me of who I used to be
Give myself up to him in offering
Let him make a woman out of me
I'm just a child but I'm not above violence
My mama raised me better than that
When the preacher talks, that man demands his silence
And daddy said shoot first then run and don't look back

Under the leaves
Nine going on eighteen
Lay it on me
Tell me a story
About how it ends
Where you're still the good guy
I'll make pretend
'Cause I hate this story
Where happiness ends
And dies with you

I thought good guys get to be happy
I'm not happy
I am poison in the water and unhappy
Little girl who needs her daddy real bad

In the corner
On my birthday
You watched me
Dancing right there in the grass

To noticе
That some types of love could bе bad
Praying I'd be like you
Doing all of the things that you do

You fell in love with America when you were twelve years old
And by seventeen, you knew you had to see it all
You loved your dad and the love he had for your mother, so
You had to get out and go chasin' its sweet call

I met you there in Texas somewhere on the thoroughfare
On the side of the road in some torn-up clothes with a pistol in my pocket
I didn't trust no one, but you said, ""Baby, don't run, I'll take you anywhere""
So I hopped right in, outta luck to spend, and at least your truck beats walking

And you said, ""Hey, do you wanna see thе west with me?
'Cause lovе's out there and I can't leave it be""
And I said, ""Honey, love's never meant much to me
But I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need""

So we made off for California
To find your lover, drivin' day and night
And every small town diner
Saw our faces at least once or twice
But in these motel rooms
I started to see you differently, oh
'Cause for the first time since I was a child
I could see a man who wasn't angry
And he said, ""It's been a long damn time since I left Florida
No one left to leave and no one left to love
But now that I met you, I finally know just where I'm headin'""
And we found heaven in time where your western sunshine
Met my deep southern wet
And you got lost in it and yet you found yourself
Hard-pressed for air and sweatin'

And you said, ""Hey, do you wanna see the west with me?
(Do you wanna see the west with me?)
'Cause love's out there and I can't leave it be""
(I can't leave it, I can't leave it)
And I said, ""Honey, love's never meant that much to me
(Nothing much)
But I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need""

And once we reached the coast, you said, ""End of the line
We finally reached the edge after all this time
I didn't find my love, but I still made it this far without it""
And then you turned to me and stared into me deep
And said, ""Well, maybe not 'cause look at what I've got
You might not be my love, but, baby, I doubt it""
And you said, ""Hey, do you wanna see the west with me?
'Cause love's out there and I can't leave it be""
(I can't leave it, I can't leave it)
And I said, ""Honey, love's never meant that much to me
But I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need""

'Cause in your pickup truck with all of your dumb luck is the only place I think I'd ever wanna be

You wanna love me right now
You wanna get alone with me
You wanna get my clothes off
And hurt me
You came alone to me
From however far away
Asking me to know how I know
You're all the same

Black leather and dark glasses
Pouring another while I shake my ass
He's cold-blooded so it takes more time to bleed
Obsession with the money, addicted to the drugs
Says he's in love with my body, that's why he's fucking it up
And then he says to me

""Baby, if it feels good
Then it can't be bad""
Where I can be immoral
In a stranger's lap
And if you want it good
Downright iconic
Something they all want
That only you can have
You wanna fuck me right now
You wanna see me on my knees
You wanna rip these clothes off
And hurt me

And if you hate me
Please don't tell me
Just let the lights bleed
All over me

If it feels good
Then it can't be bad
Where I can be immoral
In a stranger's lap
And if you want it good
Downright iconic
Then I would show you something
You can never have

Calling me the one, I'm the white light
Beautiful, finite

Hiding from something I cannot stop
Walking on shadows, I can't lead him back
Buckled on the floor when night comes along
Daddy's left and Mama won't come home
You poor thing
Sweet, mourning lamb
There's nothing you can do
It's already been done
What fear a man like you brings upon (Show me your face)

Please don't look at me
I can see it in your eyes

Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop

Blessed be their whore mothers, tired and angry waiting with bated breath in a ferry that will never move again
Blessed be the children, each and every one come to know their god through some senseless act of violence
Blessed be you, girl, promised to me by a man who can only feel hatred and contempt towards you
I am no good nor evil, simply I am, and I have come to take what is mine

I am here now as you run from me still
Run then, child

Sun bleached flies sitting in the windowsill
Waiting for the day they escape
They talk all about that money and how their babies are always changing while they're breathing in the poison of the paint
What I wouldn't give to be in Church this Sunday
Listening to the choir, so heartfelt, all singing
God loves you, but not enough to save you
So, baby girl, good luck taking care of yourself

So I said fine, 'cause that's how my daddy raised me
If they strike once then you just hit 'em twice as hard
But in the end, if I bend under the weight that they gave me
Then this heart would break and fall as twice as far

We all know how it goes
The more it hurts, the less it shows
But I still feel like they all know, and that's why I can never go back home
And I spend my life watching it go by from the sidelines
And God, I've tried, but I think it's about time I put up a fight

But I don't mind 'cause that's how my daddy raised me (How my daddy raised me)
If they strike once then you just hit 'em twice as hard
But I always knew that in the end no one was coming to save me
So I just prayed and I keep praying and praying and praying
If it's meant to be then it will be
So I met him there and told him I believe
Singing if it's meant to be then it'll be
I forgive it all as it comes back to me (Back to me)
If it's meant to be then it will be
So I met him there and told him I believe (I believe, yeah)
Singing if it's meant to be then it will be (Oh, oh)
I forgive it all as it comes back to me (It comes back to me)
If it's meant to be then it'll be (It'll be, it'll be, it'll be)
So I met him there and told him I believe (Yeah)
Singing if it's meant to be then it will be
I forgive it all as it comes back to me (Oh)

I'm still praying for that house in Nebraska
By the highway, out on the edge of town
Dancing with the windows open
I can't let go when something's broken

Tangled in my garments
Run out of space
Will i ever get to wear all of this?
Do I even like any of it?
Cheap shit

I never looked the way I pictured
The way I want

End up wearing the same old top and bottoms
There are some men I don't want looking at my parts
The same, same old top and bottoms
Day in, day out

Wish I could wear what I want to wear
Wishing to find what I want to wear
Then wishing to afford what I want to wear
What fits my boDy?
What fits a stick with a belly?

End up wearing the same old top and bottoms
There are some men I don’t want lookin' at my bottom
The same, same old top and bottoms
Day in, Day out
I just don't know what I’m doing
Some people really know a thing
I just can't feel what I'm doing
Some people really know a thing
Do I even like any of it?
Do I even like any of it?
Cheap shit

I never looked the way I pictured
The way I want, it's always strange
I try it on, it never works for me and
Will I ever stop looking for the right thing?

End up wearing the same old top and bottoms
Tangled up in the same old top and bottoms

Are getting deeper, deeper in my head
Is there a place for me where I can hide

Tastes dull after a while
There's no rest for me when I sleep
Or I’d lie still for weeks

Set me free, set me free

Will there be peace for me when I die
Or will a piece of me still cry?
Waiting for another end
For the heat death to descend
Will I feel a chill on the night
When the last star's last light
Dims to nothing
And the darkness unfolds?
Is there time after death
Or does it freeze with my last breath?
Is the time till my death

No one isn't ever gonna make it there yet
If you can't even cope with it

I can't even cope to make it last

With coats and ties and sighs all formal

As a welcoming smile breaks
And is disarming

But the committee did not turn
I grew aware that they knew that I was there
Were retorts, but no one cared

""People like you are still living in what we call the reality-based community.You believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality. That's not the way the world really works anymore. We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you are studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors, and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do""

It's so easy to set off
The molecules and the caplets
They all have something against me
Nothing I do makes me feel different

This one's like your sister's best friends
In a bath callin' you to join them
Can't avoid them
This one's like your mother's arms
When she was young and sunburned in the '80s
It lasts forever

The more level they have me
The more I cannot stand me
I have helpless friendships
And bad taste in liquids

This one's like the wilderness
Without the world, I'm gonna miss those long nights
With the windows open
I keep re-readin' the same lines
Always up at 5am every mornin'
Like a baby
It's just the lights comin' on
It's just the lights comin' on

I have no possessions
No point of view or vision
I'm just tryin' to stay in touch with
Anything I'm still in touch with

The sky is getting white
I can't find a lighter anywhere, I'm goin' crazy
But I'm not crazy
Put your heels against the wall
I swear you got a little bit taller since I saw you
I'll still destroy you

It's just the lights comin' on
It's just the lights comin' on

Feelin' defeated

I say your name, I say I'm sorry

You cannot command your love

Hand in glove

So blame it on me, I really don't care
It's a foregone conclusion

I see you in stations and on invitations
You'd fall into rivers with friends on the weekends
Innocent skies above
Carin at the liquor store, I can't wait to see you

In the house of love

So blame it on me, I really don't care

I wanted to ask if you could stay
But you were on somethin' with your friends around
There was nothin' I could say

But I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me

The next time I saw you, you were breakin' down
A million years had gone away
You looked right at me, and I just turned around
There was still nothin' I could say

But I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while

We've been stuck out here in the hallway for way, way too long
I'm at a loss, I'm at a loss, I'm losing grip, the fabric's ripped
Go back to sleep, let me drive, let me think, let me figure it out
How to get us back to the place where we were when we first went out

I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left

Losin' parents, losin' sense, I don't know what we should do
Became a father when I was still a son, she brings it out in you
See you at the end of the party with your wild white eyes
And fillin' up the teacup with gin in your secret postcard life

I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left


We leave our saviors wrapped around the necks of new machines
Or at the ends of threads that hold their bodies to the ground
And then the men who look a little like they feel like me
Offered them some bottled water, then they cut 'em down
I came back to see if you were here, but everything was different
Your voice was low, you blended in, I could barely hear you speak
You were always my last second bright spot in the distance
Thought that you were somethin' good that I would always keep
I'll still destroy you someday, sleep well, beast; you as well, beast
I'll still destroy you someday, sleep well, beast; you as well, beast
I'll still destroy you someday, sleep well, beast; you as well, beast
I'll still destroy you someday, sleep well, beast; you as well, beast

Home, home in the late night
And away, away in the half light
Except Saturday, crushed by the boring
Until played and plagued by the tourists again
When once you had believed it
Now, you see it's sucking you in
To string you along with the pretense
And pave the way for the coming release

Alone and prone in the half light
And late, late to your real life
If you find a way into the gold rush
You will stay until the morning comes

I wish that we could talk about it
But there, that's the problem
With someone new, I couldn't start it
Too late for beginnings
The little things that made me nervous
Are gone in a moment
I miss the way we used to argue
Locked in your basement

I wake up and the phone is ringing
Surprised, as it's early
And that should be a perfect warning
That something's a problem
To tell the truth, I saw it coming
The way you were breathing
But nothing can prepare you for it
The voice on the other end

The worst is all the lovely weather
I'm stunned it's not raining
The coffee isn't even bitter
Because, what's the difference?
There's all the work that needs to be done
It's late for revision
There's all the time and all the planning
And songs to be finished
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming 'til the day it stops
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming 'til the day it stops
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming and it keeps coming
And it keeps coming 'til the day it stops

I wish that we could talk about it
But there, that's the problem

Surprised you were human
There shouldn't be this radio silence
But what are the options?

When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone

Oh, you're talking forty-five turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend

It comes apart
The way it does in bad films
Except the part
Where the moral kicks in
Though when we're running out of the drugs
And the conversation's grinding away
I wouldn't trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life
You drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
And the next ten people who are trying to be polite
When you're blowing eighty-five days in the middle of France
Yeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?
And to tell the truth
Oh, this could be the last time
So here we go
Like a sales force into the night
And if I made a fool, if I made a fool
If I made a fool on the road, there's always this
And if I'm sued into submission
I can still come home to this
And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
You can sleep on the plane or review what you said
When you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tanned
You think over and over, ""Hey, I'm finally dead""
Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
You can turn it on yourself, you ridiculous clown
You forgot what you meant when you read what you said
And you always knew you were tired, but then

Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends "|0.701|0.788|2|-5.611|1|0.0425|0.148|0.625|0.0977|0.795|142.584|4|Sound of Silver

Sucked in by parlour tricks

Oh, the people deceive you, the kids never leave

And ah-ooh! You break off your plans for the weekend
And ah-ooh! You can tell them the dates
But that don't mean they're letting you go
Ah-woo-hoo! Go!

And you stay for the year
Avoid all your plans 'cause we're making our day jobs
Into a steady career
We're both high-high-high

New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down

New York, you're safer and you're wasting my time
Our records all show you were filthy but fine
But they shuttered your stores when you opened the doors
To the cops who were bored once they'd run out of crime

New York, you're perfect, oh, please don't change a thing
Your mild billionaire mayor's now convinced he's a king
And so the boring collect, I mean all disrespect
In the neighborhood bars I'd once dreamt I would drink

New York, I love you, but you're freaking me out
There's a ton of the twist, but we're fresh out of shout
Like a death in the hall that you hear through your wall

No one around, so I take off my clothes
Am I the only one in the only world?

I see the snake holes dotted in the sand
As if Seurat painted the Rio Grande
Am I the only one in the only world?

Sweating, sweating, no wind whipping behind me
Sweating, sweating, no one will ever find me

The only sound out here is my own breath
And my feet stuttering to make a path
Am I the only one in the only world?

Is that the wind finally picking up?
Is that a rattle sounding from the brush?
I'm not the only one in the only world

Prince Johnny, you're kind, but you're not simple
By now, I think I know the difference
You wanna be a son of someone

Remember the time we went and snorted
That piece of the Berlin Wall that you'd extorted
And we had such a laugh of it?
Prostrate on my carpet

You traced the Andes with your index
And bragged of when and where and who you're gonna bed next
All with sons of someone's
All with sons of someone's

Saw you pray to all to make you a real boy
Saw you pray to all to make you a real boy

Prince Johnny, you're kind, but do be careful
By now, I know just when to stand clear
When all your friends and acolytes
Holding court in bathroom stalls
Where you pray to all to make you a real boy
Saw you pray to all to make you a real boy

But honey, don't mistake my affection
For another spit-and-penny style redemption
'Cause we're all sons of someone's
We're all sons of someone's

I wanna mean more than I meant to him

I, I prefer your love to Jesus
Little baby on your knees 'cause the world has got you down

Name-tagged tourists, sick at the sight of them
Tight-walking the sidewalk in spite of them
As my headache moves from east to west
Mother, won't you open your arms and
Forgive me of all these bad thoughts?
I'm blinded to the faces in the fog

But all the good in me is because of you
It's true

I, I prefer your love to Jesus
I, I prefer your love to Jesus
Little baby on your knees 'cause the world has got you down

King-sized country wearing your worries out
Headless heroes heaped by the pylons
As a careless sun sets on the west
Sure as mother licking her finger to
Wipe the blush and smudge from my cheek and
Wonder what will become of your little one
But all the good in me is because of you
It's true

Let in what's so terrifying
Summer is as faded as a lone cicada call
Memories so bright, I gotta squint just to recall
Regret the words I've bitten

With chlorinated water
And I pleaded with my Pa
But he said, “I can’t carry you no more”

""What hell is this I made this time?

Or touch you with my gentle words?

I can hardly make you mine
Tell it to you all the time
At the end of a long day
And when I wake

If you could just give me sign
We could leave it all behind
Stop taking the long way
Before we play

I don't think I can make it
Can I owe you one
Still I lead on the days
Like a loaded gun


I can hardly make you mine
Tell it to you all the time
But you never wanted
You had to take
So I could never give you up
I guess that this is just a crush
For the end of the long day
And when I wake

But I know you're not the one or the only (only)
But we both know what it's like to be lonely (lonely)
But these fantasies they left us longing
Boy, just bring my love back to me
I guess for now this is how it'll be

I don't think I can make it
Can I owe you one (owe you one, owe you one)

Places that you go
Are a mystery to me
Every time you leave here
I'll keep them quiet

I hoped you were the way you were before
Don't give into the small talk
Don't give up on the things that we adore

Skipping all the cracks on the concrete

I've been around a few blocks
I chased away the cobwebs in the street
I wound up all the old clocks

Turn off the TV, wade in bed

Built a mansion in a day
Distant lightning, thunder claps
Watched our neighbor's house collapse
Looked the other way

We auctioned off our memories
In the absence of a breeze
Scatter what remains
Scatter what remains

Pushed away, I'm pulled toward
A comedown of revolving doors
Every warning we ignored
Drifting in from distant shores
The wind presents a change of course
A second reckoning of sorts
We were wasted, waiting for
A comedown of revolving doors

And when the days that followed passed
In another mansion built to last
From our window, we could see
Only possibilities down the road and back

I'm the blade
You're the knife
I'm the weight
You're the kite
They were right when they said
We were breathing underwater
Out of place, all the time
In a world that wasn't mine to take
I'll wait

Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?
Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?

I'm the blade

We should never meet our heroes
When they bow at their feet, in the end, it wasn't me

Am I breathing underwater?
Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?

Nights are days
We'll beat a path through the mirrored maze
I can see the end

When I get to the bottom of it, I sink
Seems like nothing I said
Ever meant anything
But a headline over my head
Thought I made a stand
Only made a scene
There's no feast for the underfed
All the unknown, dying or dead
Keep showing up in my dreams
They stand at the end of my bed
Have I ever really helped anybody but myself?
To believe in the power of songs
To believe in the power of girls
Though the point we're making is gone
Play it stripped down to my thong

I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
Our parents, daughters and sons
Believed in the power of songs
What if those days are gone?
My memory is strong
Anyone not dying is dead
And baby, it won't be long
So shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn

I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn
I'll shut up and carry on
The scream becomes a yawn

Don't say yes if you can't say no
Victim of the system, say it isn't so
Squatted on the doorstep, swallowed all the blow
Leaving without you, can't say no
Halfway starts with happiness for me
Halfway house, lost kitten in the street
Hit me where it hurts, I'm coming home to lose
Kitten on the catwalk, high-heeled shoes
No more hot-headed Saturdays
They got it, they want it, they give it away
Tell me one thing you would never do
I was looking for a hooker when I found you

You've got my eyes, you've got my eyes
You'll never be mine, ah, but you've got my eyes

When you lie, I cover it up
When you hide, I cover it up
When you cry, I cover it up
When you come undone, I cover it up

So pent up, I was coming on to you
Happy in the night time, howlin' at the moon
Sippin' on a cocktail, drinking in the loo
There's something about you I hold on to
You've got my eyes, you've got my eyes
You'll never be mine, ah, but you've got my eyes

When you lie, I cover it up
When you hide, I cover it up
When you cry, I cover it up
When you're blind, I cover it up
When you lie, I cover it up
When you hide, I cover it up
When you cry, I cover it up
When you come undone, I cover it up

They got it, they want it, they give it away

Some of us are wild ones
Ever under wanted, I believe
Lining up in the background
Waiting for the crowd shot to be seen
In the shadow of the big screen
Everybody begs to be redeemed

Hey, I'm not synthetica
I'll keep the life that I've got

We were never meant to
Crawl in for the bait
We never will
I can think for myself
I've got something no pill could ever kill

Hey, I'm not synthetica
I'll keep the life that I've got
So hard, hard to resist synthetica
No drug is stronger than me
Synthetica
We're all the time confined to fit the mold
But I won't ever let them make a loser of my soul

I've been sleepwalking through the railway station
Wake me up when they call my destination
Where I've been, I was bound to leave behind
All device and all disease was mine
(Oh, oh) Speeding out of reach
(Oh, oh) You're the one I had to meet

I never wanted to go home
The wanderlust will carry us on
There was nothing there for me
The wanderlust will carry us on
In a high rise on my own
I've been on the prince of highways for so long
Looking out at a mirror balcony
Wanderlust will carry us on
Will there ever be a place for you and me?
Wanderlust
I'm rolling in for a seven day weekend
Living up again to my old reputation
Can you cover me?
'Cause I got no armor
Keep on moving down the line, keep on going further

The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you?
Alone on an aeroplane
Falling asleep against the windowpane
My blood'll thicken

I need to wash myself again
To hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath
And who are my real friends?
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking this low?

My baby's got the bends, oh no
We don't have any real friends
No, no, no

Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the '60s, I wish we could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
They brought in the CIA
The tanks and the whole marines
To blow me away, to blow me sky high

Two jumps in a week, I bet you
Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror

Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out

A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In a fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plants
To get rid of itself

It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out

And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted

I don't want to be crippled and cracked
Shoulders, wrists, knees, and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours

When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones

Now I can't climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozac, painkillers

When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones

And I used to fly like Peter Pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands

Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends

Faith, you're driving me away
You do it every day
You don't mean it, but it hurts like hell
My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support, my iron lung

We're too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are losing it, can't you tell?
We scratch our eternal itch
Our twentieth century bitch
We are grateful for our iron lung
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out, we'll just hum
This, this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time, my iron lung

Heat the pins and stab them in

There's no other way, never run far
Take a good swing at me and everything is even
So finally, we agree: no place for promises here
You better run, you better run so

Hide, hide, I have burned your bridges
I will be a gun and it's you I'll come for
Hide, hide, now it's all so easy
I will be a gun and it's you I'll come for
Who are you to tell me how
To keep myself afloat
I treaded water all the while
You stuck in the knife that you held at my back

Did it make you feel so clever?
Did you wear it on your sleeve?
Did you see another lifetime
Where I was not a part so far entwined?
There's no other way, never run far
Take a good swing at me and everything is even
So finally, we agree: no place for promises here
You better run, you better run so

Now I'll be a gun and it's you I'll come for

Where'd you go? You were there by my side
Keep believing it's my turn to hide
In a place where we don't have a prayer
There's a tether that's keeping me there

Trade our places
Take no chances
Bind me 'til my lips are silent
Stay where you are
Ever, after
Chasing things that we should run from

Will we ever get away from this place?
It's an image that's burned on my chest
For a moment you need me to stay
Cold-blooded and drifting away

Trade our places
Take no chances
Bind me 'til my lips are silent
Stay where you are
Ever, after
Chasing things that we should run from

Faster, faster, you won't go far
Shouldn't leave, feeling faint, we both know why
You got to show me both knees, cold, I lie
Hold me slowly, hide me till I can fight
Always, we can sing, we can make time
Old songs, flood and flame, you could be mine
But you got to show me both knees, skin and bone
Clothe me, throw me, move me till

I'm watching you run
Run from the sidelines
Take in a breath, fill in your lungs
Keeping you alive
No fear, I'll be your eyes
I'll be your lifeline
And if I can be, I'll be your strength
And it won't be long now

Head up, head up
Keep holding, holding
Your head up, head up
Keep holding

If you can see and you believe
Why are you so scared?
But if you don't care, then why are we here
And what do you have left?

Head up, head up
Keep holding, holding
Your head up, head up
Keep holding, holding
Don't you take another step away from here
""I would go anywhere with you""
What a lie
I'll break down, but you will never see
Tell me, are you happy?
Are you really happy?

Stay under the tide
Stay in my eye line
Looking ahead, there is a chance
Wherever it all ends

Head up, head up
And stay strong
Holding your head up, head up
Keep holding, holding

Try to retie the ties
That you will leave behind

Caught out, cold
Hiding from you in a skin so old

I will carry you and give you life
I will cover you and show you the way
It's a sequence that you never learned
It's a lesson I will never forget
I can hear you in the overtones
Just an echo of the promise we made
Change the future, we can travel time
Or make us blind, so we can never look back
We can never look back

I'm the only one who gave you the truth (Speak to me)

Give me something to remember you by (Always be)
All that's here is what you left behind (Majesty)

Why don't you tell me? What do you need?
There is a blank page for you
Give me the bones of what you believe
Maybe they'll save you from me
Will I be the strong hand keeping you safe?
Or will I break you in half?
And you will never be under my thumb
But you are not your own man

See the way we all run
When we know it all off by heart
Play it down, wait it all out
Will we win or lose it this time?

When the pressure's building for a great white hope
Do you give up the things that you love?
And the pressure's building till it takes you whole
Can you go back on your own word?

All of your brothers, they never died
For what you kill for slowly
How it will grind you into the ground
If you should try to hold me
See the way we all run
When we know it all off by heart
Play it down, wait it all out
Will we win or lose it this time?

It's like I've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
The sweetest flowered fruits were hangin' from the trees
Fallin' off the giant bird that's been carryin' me
It's like I've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream

Just exactly as I remember
Every word, every gesture
I've my heart in my mouth

Like I've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying

And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I'm a fish now out of water

(Did so much, did so much)
Fallen off a giant bird that's been carryin' me

I fell open, I lay under
At the tip off, lost your number
I wanna slip over and get back under
And if you think this is over, then you're wrong
If you think this is over, then you're wrong

Maybe when my womb is broken open and I can
Hold you with the joy of knowing there is no other
Fear will slip away and I can know that finally
Love is something I'll know
Always had the tendency to believe
Hiding from the truth could maybe set you free
After you dance that Hollywood mingle
Surrender yourself to the dream

I know you and me are not so much
I know you and me can make it far
But the bodies and lips moving
Hips sway, hearts drop
I know you and me are not so much
I know you and me can make it far
'Cause we're bred from Barbie Nation
We know pure elation, yeah

Suddenly within the little frame that I know
You'll grow into every corner shamed by the shadow
Sweetening the years when we grow together
Drinking all that TV glow
I can never shade you no, you will see
All the dark and lovely flow you will be
Stronger 'cause you'll always know the woman's weight
And happier than I'll ever be

Than divulge truth this sadly

I found you in my dreams, running between the sheets
I follow touches from your fingers twisting all over my skin
I try for everything, to be your girl and king
Perfection never shines its light on me but still I chase the sun
We're always breaking through our love and what we do
'Cause when it happens off the screen it can't be right
You might be more than me, you say you want me free
You cannot know me, no you cannot

Tell me how it is
When you can go away
You know that there is everything I will not say
Tell me how it is
When you will know my face
You know that nothing scares me the way you scare me, now

I'm fighting with my mind along this lonely grind
Don't tell me truth, I'm running far so I don't even have to know
Remember when we met, I thought you'd never let
A broken girl like me run wild in your perfect little world
I don't believe you're true, I'm fighting all of you
To understand my plight against the shiny
I'll never trust it all, but boy it's not your fault
You cannot know me, no, you cannot
Tell me how it is
When you can go away
You know that there is everything I will not say
Tell me how it is
When you will know my face
You know that nothing scares me the way you scare me
Tell me how it is
When you can go away
You know that there is everything I will not say
Tell me how it is
When you will know my face
You know that nothing scares me the way you scare me, now

Can't you see there's something mad about us?
Birthing truth when nothing matters but lust
Don't be sure of what you see, oh no
I'm not sure of who we'll be, oh no
Can't you see there's something mad about us?

Tell me how it is
When you can go away
You know that there is everything I will not say

Make me talk and set me free
Tell me who I'm meant to be
Fake originality
Everyone is nothing

Without resisting all the weak
Would we ever know we're able?
Give me something I can eat
I need your words I need your power
I have my money all around
Just take your clothes off, make me proud
I have my money all around
You look me up I'm crawling down

Little boy, I'll never see
Everything you mean to me
Keep you running on your feet
Let your head fall heavy

Without resisting all the weak
Would we ever know we're able?
Give me something I can eat
I need your words I need your power
I have my money all around
Just take your clothes off, make me proud
I have my money all around
You look me up I'm crawling down

And the time, oh the time, it's just running through
And I feel the weight of all we can do
You and me, oh I know there's nothing better yet
Say the words, take a chance you know you won't regret
And we try and we try but it's still the same
Judgement calls and I know that we can't be blamed
Oh, I'd leave it all if it weren't for you
Understand the fall if it weren't for you

I know it's mine until
The day your head will fill
The little things they get me crazy
The only way you know me, baby
I'll shut my mouth as told
Leave judgment for the bold
We're only running just to catch up
Believing that we never fucked up

The monuments will show
We were meant for so much better
Betraying all the glow
Heavenly and held forever
Preceding eyes will hold
Fragments of the plastic gathered
Let go of the shame
They won't know the blame

I''ll lose myself in skies
Supporting all my cries
We'll stop the war and we'll just undress
It only matters when you're famous
It's frantic when you chose
Perception gripping you
I'm living for the hedonistic
It only matters when you risk it
The monuments will show
We were meant for so much better
Betraying all the glow
Heavenly and held forever
Preceding eyes will hold
Fragments of the plastic gathered
Let go of the shame
They won't know the blame

You go away, I know that I can call anytime
But hours shake the girl, making me unsure
I know that I can fumble the days
My words will slip all over the days
'Cause time is pushing through
And nothing's stopping you
So baby won't you hold up my hair
And tell me that you always will care
With bile on my lips and falling off in drips
The saddest part is living for one
When every moment we're told to run
And I'm not meant for this, retreating for the bliss

The monuments will show
We were meant for so much better
Betraying all the glow
Heavenly and held forever
Preceding eyes will hold
Fragments of the plastic gathered
Let go of the shame
They won't know the blame
The monuments will show
We were meant for so much better
Betraying all the glow
Heavenly and held forever
Preceding eyes will hold

Let go of the shame

I'm always far below
The underdog that shows
Hold me together this time
And when I'm broken through
Retreating far from you
Try to remember it's fine
On all the lightest days
I slip beneath the haze
Of tighter bodies than mine
And while my eyes are true
They're always far from new
Don't blame yourself, we'll blame the time

It's always up, up, up
It's always mine
Argue for whatever this time
And so we wash our skin
So clean but not within
Plaster on your smile this time

My fate is up to those
Dictating beauty flows
I'll hide away until the night
And in the darkness pure
Our senses won't be sure
Relying only on the trite
Just sick of all the pain
And Puritan-like shame
That follows me into the light
This doesn't need to be
We could just all break free
Salvation lies beyond the fight
It's always up, up, up
It's always mine
Argue for whatever this time
And so we wash our skin
So clean but not within
Plaster on your smile this time

We're diving into all you say you know
Tied together still alone, darling
Frustrated and I know it's getting old
Jealous of the young and gold toys
Please tell me you agree with what you see
Lies are sweetest when we're not free
I'll say that I'm never affected when
Guilt is shaking up my head
Let me go

It's always up, up, up
It's always mine
Argue for whatever this time
And so we wash our skin
So clean but not within
Plaster on your smile this time
It's always up, up, up
It's always mine

Somehow every corner always calls up
Begging me to be the better or the best of
But I'd like to think it doesn't really matter
So let's drop it 'cause it doesn't really matter
Maybe I'll defy and it will fade out
Growing pale when no contrast can be made out
But I'd like to think it doesn't really matter
Let's just drop it 'cause it doesn't really matter

Oh, watch my best friends
We'll never say the things they do

I'd rather flee than follow suit

Time will never let me take it back there
We can run 'cause you know that I will not care
Every action points to life beyond the reform
You know they'll forget about the before
All I want is just to spread all of the best love
Make you happy, make you realize you're the best of
Make you strong enough to do it for the reform

Faking it forever but we're honest as we sink
Won't you take me out for lunch?
Won't you spoil me undone?
Self-conscious and guilty, walking tired through the streets
I need your attention, need to know just what you see
Won't you eat me out at lunch?
Yeah just let me go I'm done

Yeah, turn it up

I'm a bitch, modern witch
I'm a student in the failure of love
And it hurt, and it burned
But the angels sing to me from above

If it's done then he's not the one

Soon, you'll know the ancient garden
You're a flower, you are the sun

I'm so hopeless and over you

Wake me in the morning I'm afraid
I don't want to go to sleep and see your face
I need you more than I should ever say
What about you? What about you?
The stars are always taunting me at night
Remind me that I'm not the only life
Sometimes I don't wanna know they're right
What about you? What about you?
While humanity's begging to end
As eternity's starting again
I'll be hanging on all that you said
I just can't believe it

I don't wanna hear you say
You don't love me anyway
After all I do, I do it for you
I don't wanna hear you say
I don't love you anyway
After all I do, I do it all for you

A million years won't dry away my eyes
A hundred thousand hearts will know my cry
Romantic for the sake of my demise
What about you? What about you?
When the cosmos holds everything dead
When the oceans have leveled my bed
I'll be hanging on all that you said
I hope you believe it, yeah

I don't wanna hear you say
You don't love me anyway
After all I do, I do it for you
I don't wanna hear you say

Oh, it's you and me every time I dream
Let me take you everywhere I go
We can skip this town, get away for now
I want a wedding like a Broadway show
With a fountain made of chocolate, looking famous
And our statues made of gold, how could you blame us?
Is it love you need? Does your heart not bleed?
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon let me know
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon let me know

Sometimes when I'm alone I feel someone next to me
And one time when I got home, they moved all my groceries
Dark in the night I'll open up my eyes and see
Stark in the moonlight, something floating in front of me
But you don't have to worry, these angels keep me safe
Like when I tried to end my life, they wouldn't allow that fate
I cried as I drove home that day, I thought it all would break
Luckily the winter only leads to flowers in the spring

Don't keep me any longer, I can't hold my breath
It's cold beneath the water but I understand
At least we had a story, wasn't that the plan?
I always wear your sweater, please don't hold my hand
So can we call it over if I'm still beneath
The weight of primavera when you finally sneaked
Into my little bedroom when I had to pee
At least you said goodbye

Take me out tonight

That maybe we could talk, I'll buy your flight

Coming from a space craft
Would you tell me that you think I'm pretty?

Once upon an orange grove
Where bodies never held their consistence, at night
That's when everything was really, alright
Never had to understand the silly laws
We saw and gravity wouldn't ever fall
There the future and the past
Have always been intrinsically mended, alright
Doesn't matter if it's dark or, it's light
Every feeling that you had or ever would
It lived inside you as you know it should (one, two, three)

Maybe on a Saturday
Tell me can I see you again? Ooh-whoa
I'm just here waiting for you
Come on, you know that it's true
One million butterflies are next to me
Oh, you know that I can't pretend, no
I'm just here waiting for you
Come on, you know that it's true

Now we're here on earth
The other planets only mock our existence, ya know
Yeah, they pull upon the human, ego
Don't you wish that every dream you ever conjured up
Delivered you from evil, but
Saturn's lying next to us
He's laughing, teasing, ""This is your lesson"", okay
""Don't believe all of the worst of, your days
""Every time you think of dying you should wait
Because the romance might be here to stay""

I wonder if I even look like you
My horoscope told me not to feel blue
What's the point of all of these love songs?
You've replaced me now, let me you too
I was in 5th grade, where is your shame?
The Beastie Boys didn't own their own airplane
Do you recognize your own daughter?
Is your life much better without her?

Walking up to me expecting words
It happens all the time
Present company excepted
Present company except the worst
It happens every night

Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company excluded every time
Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company, the best that you can find

Talking like a jerk
Except you are an actual jerk
And living proof that sometimes friends are mean
Present company expect it
Present company, just laugh it off
It's better than it seems

Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company excluded in every way
Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company, makes me wanna stay
Go
Killing it with close inspection
Killing it can only make it worse
It sort of makes it breed
Present company accepting
Presently we all expect the worst
It works just like a need

Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah

Ah-ahhhh-ah-ah
Present company included in the fight

Ah-ahhhhhhh

Don't you want me to wake up
Then give me just a bit of your time
Arguments are made for make-ups
So give it just a little more time
We've got to bring the resources
I wanna play it 'til the time comes
Forget your string of divorces
You go and throw your little hands up
It's late
Oh
Honey, it's late
Oh

I miss the way the night goes
With friends who always make it feel good
This basement has a cold glow
Though it's better than a bunch of others

So go and dance yourself clean
Go and dance yourself clean
You're blowing Marxism to pieces
Their little arguments to pieces

It's your show
It's your show
It's your show
It's your show
It's your show...
Put your little feet down
And hang out
Every night's a different story
It's a thirty car pile-up with you
Everybody's getting younger
It's the end of an era, it's true

And you go
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop

Break me into bigger pieces
So some of me is home with you
Wait until the weekend
And we can make our bad dreams come true
And it's a-go
Yeah, it's a-go
And if we wait until the weekend
We can miss the best things to do

Go and dance yourself clean, ah
Go and dance yourself clean, yeah
And blow the Marxists into pieces
Their little arguments to pieces

We should try a little harder
In the tedious march of the few
Every day's a different warning

From this position
I will relax
From this position
I can see the whole place
From this position
Oh, oh just relax
From this position
I make some stand
I make my peace with the man

And it goes pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
It goes pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow

From this position
I can see both of them
From this position
I totally get how the decision was reached
From this position
I can say ""serious,"" or ""cop-out,"" or ""hard to define""
From this position, from this position
It's kind of like eating myself to death
With you on the outside
And me on the inside
There's advantages to both
(Advantages to both!)
And me being uptight
And you being all right
There's advantages to each
(Advantages! Advantages!)

From this perspective, from this position
I have a good grip on both of them
Because I have stayed home
And have learned a little more about my neighbourhood
Which is important
You know, there's a lot of good places to eat

So it goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
So it's pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
It goes pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
With you on the keystroke
And me on the gangplank
There's advantages to both
(Advantages to both)
And you have been all right
And I have been filmed being ridiculous
Oh, eat it, Michael Musto
(You're no Bruce Vilanch!)
Now I have been untied
And you are all cross-eyed
There's advantages to each
(Advantages to each)
And I'm coming back, coming back, coming back
Until there's nothing left in the well
Is that what they call it, the well?

I'm paralyzed
And looking through you
But if nothing's right
We try anyway
As a compromised, aggregate person
I'm amazed at my decision to play

On this occasion, there are a couple of things that we know that we pulled from Fact Magazine
One, the king wears a king hat and lives in a king house
Two, your time will come, but tonight is our night
So you should give us all of your drugs
Three, we have a black president and you do not, so shut up, because you don't know shit about where I'm from that you didn't get from TV
So times have been tough
And times have been tough
You have been put down, washed up, and rinsed out
But honestly
And be honest with yourself
How much time do you waste?
How much time do you blow every day?
And so it's pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Oh, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
So pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow

(The return of the police)

With you on the inside
And me on the outside
There's advantages to both
(Advantages to both!)
With me being wired
And you being tired
There's advantages to each
(Advantages! Advantages!)

From this position
I feel an affinity for the both of them, which is confusing
But honestly
I should be careful because otherwise, I'm being, I'm being, you know, what's it called?
Oh, fuck it
Reclining, I'm getting used to it
Like kissing under a bridge
It's an entirely new
Discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery
And then a couple of weeks at home
And then a couple of weeks away
And then home and away, again
To use up your desire for
Discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery

For an instant
You could have pushed through
But it's a plagiarized
Regret anyway
But what you want for now
Is someone to feel you
And that's the thing you like
Is planning to stay
And all this time
It's so nice
It's so nice
It's so nice

When I think of you in the city
The sight of you among the sights
I get the sudden sinking feeling
Of a man about to fly
It never kept me up before
Now I've been awake for days
I can't fight it anymore
I'm going through an awkward phase
I am secretly in love with
Everyone that I grew up with
I do my crying underwater
I can't get down any farther
All my drowning friends can see
Now there is no running from it
It's become the crux of me
I wish that I could rise above it

But I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons

Bats and buzzards in the sky
Alligators in the sewers
I don't even wonder why
I hide among the younger viewers
I huddle with them all night long
The worried talk to God goes on
I sincerely tried to love it
I wish that I could rise above it
But I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons
I stay down with my demons

Can I stay here? I can sleep on the floor
Paint the blood and hang the palms on the door
I do not think I'm going places anymore
I wanna see the sun come up above New York
Oh, every day I start so great, and then the sunlight dims
The less I look, the more I see the pythons in the limbs
I do not know what's wrong with me, the sour is in the cut
When I walk into a room, I do not light it up
Fuck

I don't see what's strange about this
Tiny bubbles hang above me
It's a sign that someone loves me
I can hardly stand up right
I hit my head upon the light
I have faith but don't believe it
It's not there enough to leave it

Everything I love is on the table
Everything I love is out to sea

I have only two emotions
Careful fear and dead devotion
I can't get the balance right
With all my marbles in the fight
I see all the ones I went for
All the things I had it in for
I won't cry until I hear
'Cause I was not supposed to be here

Everything I love is on the table
Everything I love is out to sea

I'll never be

I'm evergreen

I'm tired, I'm freezing, I'm dumb

I survived the dinner
Then the air went thinner
I retire to the briars
By the pool, it gets so loud
If I die this instant
Taken from the distance
They will probably list it down
Among other things around town

Got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down
In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of a white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound

And all the L.A. women
Fall asleep while swimmin'
I got paid to fish 'em out
And then one day I lost the job
And I cried a little
I got fried a little
Then she laid her eyes on mine
And she said, ""Babe, you're better off""
I got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down
In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of a white menace

Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave my little life today

As a free fall advances, I'm the moron who dances

I was teething on roses, I was in guns and noses
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Under the withering white skies of humiliation

Forgotten hands are the ones which we choose
To let go of, but it is no less a bruise
On the collective arm keeping us high and gone
Forgotten dance is the one left at birth
Forgotten plants in the fossils of earth
And they've long passed but they are no less the dirt
Of the common soil keeping us dry and warm

The wound has no direction
Everybody needs a home and deserves protection‚ hmm-mm

Hollow-eyed on Eddie Street‚ no sirens to hear
Just trash and soiled needles clawing the veneer
And no crying but it is no less a tear
On the common cheek with which we smile
Hollow-eyed on Eddie‚ is it they or is it I?
Is it me who is more hollow as I'm quickly passing by?
And the poison is killing them, but then so am I
As I turn away

The wound has no direction
Everybody needs a home and deserves protection, hmm-mm

You somehow let me down
Both hands and a gentleman
You could not take me through
New plans or tell me who
New friends, I can make some too
I know
You somehow took me in
Both arms, my marked up skin
Two hands, places you had been
I needed

And the more that we try
To figure through the answers
To repeat ourselves
To deny, deny

Now you call my bluff
All clear and it gets so rough
Stone-faced in the light
The air and the jagged bite
Cold air, the wisdom of the night
Between us
And the more that we try
To figure through the answers
To repeat ourselves
To deny, deny
To deny, deny, deny

Somehow we exist
In the folds, and now we'll kiss
Both hands, the mystery before us
She's reaching
But I could not take you through
New plans, or tell you who
New friends, you can make some too

Goodbye, goodbye
Like a seed in the wind
She's taking up root in the sky
See her flickering
Her system won't even try
To defend and ripen
In the radio action

She'll never return again
Polarize, polarize
The seasons will bend
There will soon be proof
That there is no alien
Just a system of truth and lies
The reason, the language
And the law of attraction

You'll disappear

I never could leave you to struggle
Hold the line, hold the line

Everyone does see trouble

And you don’t need to know why when you cry
You don’t need to know why
You don’t need to know why when you cry

Violet’s eyes, Violet plays
Going back home to the Great Lakes
Where the cattail sways
With the lonesome loon
Riding that train in late June

With the windows wide by my side
With the windows wide
With the windows wide by my side

And the clusters fell like an empty bell
Meteor shower at the motel
Where the empty space is a saving grace
Making good time and doing well
Still the question sings like Saturn’s rings
Maybe she knows and she won’t tell
But you don’t need to know why when you cry
You don’t need to know why
You don’t need to know why when you cry

And I find you there in your country flair
Middle of the river in a lawn chair
With your wrinkled hands and your silver hair
Leaving here soon and you know where
To where the cattail sways with the lonesome loon
You’ll be riding that train in late June

With the windows wide by your side
With the windows wide
With the windows wide by your side

Orange is the color of my love
Fragile orange wind in the garden
Fragile means that I can hear her flesh
Crying little rivers in her forearm
Fragile is that I mourn her death
As our limbs are twisting in her bedroom

Lies, lies, lies
Lies in her eyes
Lies, lies, lies
Lies in her eyes

She tells me to close and count to ten
As she wanders freely through the forest
Can I close and open once again?
The question that I seek for reassurance

Lies, lies, lies
Lies in her eyes
Lies, lies, lies
Lies in her eyes
Hound dogs crowing at the stars above
Pigeons fall like snowflakes at the border
She kneels down and holds the frozen dove
The moon drips like water from her shoulder

Flies, flies, flies
Flies from her eyes
Flies, flies, flies
Flies from her eyes

Dogs eyes in the headlights of the driveway
Cool autumn rain
Bugs died on your windshield on the freeway
Wonder if you'll be the same
Centuries flower

And we have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power

Moth flies in the window of the kitchen
You hang up your coat
Cold lips and gold eyes listen
There's something that I want you to know
Turn on the shower

'Cause we have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power
No resolution, no circling dove
Still caught in the jaw of confusion
Don't know what I'd do for love

Doesn't it seem strange
Searching for a hidden page
The fairy’s cage
Coming of true age
Leave the costume on the stage
The silkworm's rage
Iridescent thread, beautiful and dead
Billions of worms were boiled to make the bed

Strange, see the luna moth cry
Lime green tears through the fruit bat's eyes

Scatter and destroy
Every power you enjoy
To lay with the void
Twirling of the dime, splitting of the mind
Drawing constellations ’til the stars align

Strange, see the luna moth cry (Cry)
Lime green tears through the fruit bat's eyes (Eyes)

I thought the crumbs of your life wouldn't dry
It hurts to see clearer
Falling like needles, the passage of time

Heaven is stitching across me
My chest is the crossing
The blood is parting all the time, but I don't mind

Bring me the company I couldn't buy

You come in, check my time
You've got fornication crimes
I've seen your hope on television
Where you've been, you were not were

All the lights we were

How they need something that's so hard
To come a time, some time we spent
(I cried for we when all was to come free
At the broken heart in the room)
Split your tongue down the semi kind
And show us lovers that don't love to live
Lick the kill that never knew
Eat the trees and then get off on time
Get us something with the finger kids

Put your teeth where you love to love
Drink some spit just to save your life
Bury parents in a moments time
Hate it all and you still use shampoo
You hate it all and you still use shampoo
Find some bullets in a backyard
Shoot them up with your favorite kid
Free them up like its another knife
Save them for when you thought you did
Seen the tricks all use shampoo
You hate it all

Like the something of simple time
It tastes so good

It goes ""tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight""
I never realized these artists thought so much about dying
But truth be told we all have the same end
Could make you cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
But I'm telling you
This is the best news you're getting all week
Oh sure it's ruling the airwaves
Or what remains of the airwaves
And we're frankly thankful for the market psychology you're hipping us to
And all the hits are saying the same thing
There's only tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
And life is finite
But shit, it feels like forever
It feels like forever
Oh is everybody feeling the same stuff?
We're all wild
Except for you
And you know who you are
This is a love song
And you're getting older
I promise you this; you're getting older
And there's improvements unless
You're such a winner
That the future's a nightmare
And there's nothing I can do
Nothing anyone can do about this
And oh, I'm offering you a chance to get even
But oh, you know very well the dialect of negation
Sure enemies haunt you with spit and derision
But friends are the ones who can put you in an exile
But that's not right
And you're too sharp to be used
Or you're too shocked from being used
By these bullying children of the fabulous
Raffling off limited edition shoes

Set to parry the cocksure of mem-stick filth
With my own late era middle-aged ramblings

And luck is always better than skill at things
We're flying blind
Oh good gracious
I sound like my mom
But out of the little rooms and onto the streets
You've lost your internet and we've lost our memory
We had a paper trail that led to our secrets
But embarrassing pictures have now all been deleted
By versions of selves that we thought were the best ones
'Til versions of versions of others repeating
Come laughing at everything we thought was important
While still making mistakes that you thought you had learned from
And reasonable people know better than you
That cost in the long run but they don't know the short game
And terrible people know better than you
The use and abuse of the wants of dear listener
So you will be badgered and taunted and told that
You're missing a party that you'll never get over

It moves like a virus and enters our skin
The first sign divides us, the second is moving to Berlin
But that's not the state I'm in
The air is thin but that's not the state
The old guys are frightened and frightening to behold
The kids come out fighting and still doing what they're told

The quiet, unhappy punk
See mother was a cripple and my father was a drunk but gentle man
So we do the best we can
This is the plan
Wear your makeup like a man

Yeah, we don't waste time with love
It's just a push and a shove
Well, there's a full-blown rebellion but you're easy to confuse
By trigger kids and fakers and some questionable views
Oh, call the cops, call the preachers!
Before they let us and they lose
When oh, we all start arguing the history of the Jews
You got nothing left to lose
Gives me the blues

Wake up with somebody near you
And at someone else's place
You took acid and looked in the mirror
Watched the beard crawl around on your face
Oh, the revolution was here
That would set you free from those bourgeoisie
In the morning everything's clearer
When the sunlight exposes your age

But that's okay
And that's okay

Grab your clothes and head to the doorway
If you dance out, no one complains
Find the place where you can be boring
Where you won't need to explain
That you're sick in the head and you wish you were dead
Or at least instead of sleeping here you prefer your own bed, come on
You just suck at self-preservation
Versus someone else's pain

So you feel drained
And insane
And insane
He was leather and you were screaming
Swinging chains against the stage
And you couldn't know he was leaving
But now more will go with age, you know
So get up and stop your complaining
You know that you're the only one who's been destroying all the fun
Look what happened when you were dreaming
Then punch yourself in the face
So you kiss and you clutch but you can't fight that feeling
That your one true love is just awaiting your big meeting
So you never even asked for names
You just look right through them as if you already came

It's a drug of the heart and you can't stop the shaking
'Cause the body wants what it's terrible at taking, oh
And you can't remember the meaning
But there's no going back against this California feeling

It seems that I've been misunderstood
The look of grave concern in your eyes and your surprise at my emotional haircut
It’s better to me
It's much better than it used to be
'Cause I got eyes going every which way
I got eyes all over the place
And I got tired of the hotel room and the TV
You wish that you’d been told about whatever has led to this emotional haircut
It ain't a disease
It's just hard to do whatever you please
And treat yourself tonight
To a little love life
Now we all get ideas and then shut-shut 'em down with an emotional haircut
No I ain't Dionysian, man
Oh no buddy, no need to be concerned with this emotional haircut
It's part of the game
Yeah man, it's just part of the feat
So let's raise a glass to the bodies in here
Oh, raise a glass to the bodies in here
We’re gonna toast till the bodies all soak up the bass
Man, you’re in love with the bodies in here and your emotional haircut
Oh just get on the street
Fuck the shuffle, put your shit on repeat
You've got numbers on your phone of the dead that you can’t delete
And you got life-affirming moments in your past that you can't repeat
Yeah you've numbers on your phone of your dead that you cannot delete
And you're losing all your skin in the middle when you just can’t sleep
I know you can't calm down
Out of your windows and onto the streets
Out of your windows
Out of it
Out to
Do you know what it does?
It puts me up on my feet
It puts me on the floor
But can you hear the heartbeat
Can you hear the heartbeat
Just listen to the heartbeat
But can you hear the heartbeat

Listen to it now

Too sick to travel
You fell between a friend
And a father
I owe you dinner, man
I owe you something
You talked to me
Like I was inside
We were just waking up
For a hard
Interrupt
I meant to get to you
On the turning
Things sneak up on me
Like a landslide comes
Been saving email trails
Kept together
I read them back sometimes
To remember
The time I wrote to you
From the island
Your quick replies
Made me high
I had fear in the room
So I stopped turning up
My hands kept pushing down
In my pockets
I’m bad with people things
But I should have tried more
Been watching images
From the station
Earth one from satellites
All streaming
Feels slow at seventeen thousand miles an hour
You could be anywhere
On the black screen
On the black screen
On the black screen
On the black screen
On the black screen
You could be anywhere
